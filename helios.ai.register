#   GREP: wc -l src/tts/tts.ts
#
# BUG: Test coverage gaps
#   SUSPECTED FEATURE: All features
#   EVIDENCE: 1123 files without corresponding test files
#   GREP: comm -23 <(find src -name "*.ts" | grep -v test | sort) <(find src -name "*.test.ts" | sed 's/.test//' | sort) | wc -l

## Bug Fix History
