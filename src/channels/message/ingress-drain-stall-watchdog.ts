/**
 * Pre-adoption stall watchdog for the channel ingress drain.
 *
 * Extracted from ingress-drain.ts so the stall/cancellation policy has one
 * inspectable home (and so ingress-drain.ts stays under its max-lines budget).
 *
 * Policy, in order:
 *  1. A pre-adoption stall means the event was never handled. Aborting and
 *     immediately dead-lettering destroys an inbound user message whenever the
 *     agent is merely busy for longer than the stall window.
 *  2. AbortSignal is cooperative: abort() returns before the dispatch actually
 *     exits. Releasing the claim at that moment lets the monitor re-claim and
 *     re-dispatch the same event while the original callback can still produce
 *     side effects (duplicate agent work or duplicate replies). So a release is
 *     fenced behind dispatch quiescence.
 *  3. If the dispatch does not quiesce within the fence window, ownership is
 *     HELD rather than released. Wedged-but-owned beats duplicated delivery,
 *     matching the tombstone/fail-write policy elsewhere in this module.
 *  4. Dead-lettering is terminal and cannot be re-dispatched, so it does not
 *     need the fence.
