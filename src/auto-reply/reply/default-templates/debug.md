Debug this step by step using systematic reasoning.

1. **Understand the symptoms** – What is the observed behaviour vs the expected behaviour?
2. **Reproduce** – Identify the minimal conditions that trigger the issue.
3. **Hypothesise** – List the most likely root causes ranked by probability.
4. **Investigate** – For each hypothesis, describe what evidence would confirm or rule it out.
5. **Diagnose** – State the root cause once identified and explain the reasoning chain.
6. **Fix** – Propose a targeted fix and any follow-up improvements to prevent regression.

Think out loud at each step.
