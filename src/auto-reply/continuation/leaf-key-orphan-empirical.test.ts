/**
 * EMPIRICAL orphan-proof for the #978/#3 leaf-key-vs-parent-key layer-question.
 *
 * The dispute (2026-06-09 lag-storm): a deny-tools/light-context leaf emitting
 * `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ... | post-compaction]]` — should the staged delegate be
 * keyed under the LEAF's own sessionKey (in-turn, "mirror tool :235") or the
 * PARENT's requesterSessionKey (announce-path, `855fa37`'s :996)?
 *
 * Camp-in-turn (🌊): "stage under leaf-key in-turn; the leaf's own next
 *   compaction consumes it; no orphan."
 * Camp-parent-key (🌿 + 🩸): "the deny-tools leaf is one-shot, emits the bracket
 *   as its response-tail, never compacts before :1511 deletes it → leaf-key
 *   orphans; only the long-lived parent reliably compacts + consumes."
 *
 * This test settles it EMPIRICALLY against the real delegate-store, with NO
 * source-reading. It proves the store is strictly KEYED: a delegate staged under
 * key-A is invisible to consume(key-B), and nothing migrates leaf→parent. So a
 * leaf that never compacts (light-context) and is then deleted leaves the
 * delegate with NO surviving consumer = orphan.
