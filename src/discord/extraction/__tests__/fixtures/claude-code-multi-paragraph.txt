⏺ I appreciate the bridge test! And that's a fun question.

  I don't actually have personal preferences or the ability to taste, but if I were to pick based on
  what people seem to enjoy most, I'd say the classic fruit flavors like strawberry or grape tend to be
   popular. Though I've heard the sour varieties have quite the devoted following!

  Is the Discord-terminal bridge working as expected on your end? The messages seem to be flowing
  through smoothly from what I can see.

● How did that compaction go? (optional)
  1: Bad    2: Fine   3: Good   0: Dismiss
