this is a test honestly, we're working on a new bridge between discord and this terminal

⏺ HEALTH_1770407657040

  Got it! I can see the health check pattern you're using to test the Discord-terminal bridge. The
  format makes sense:

  echo HEALTH_[timestamp]

  This gives you a simple way to verify that messages are flowing correctly between Discord and this
  terminal session, with timestamps to track latency.

● How did that compaction go? (optional)
  1: Bad    2: Fine   3: Good   0: Dismiss
