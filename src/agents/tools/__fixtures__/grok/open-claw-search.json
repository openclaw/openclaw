It performs real-world tasks like managing emails, calendars, flights, and more via chat apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.), with full system access, browser control, and extensible \"skills.\"[[1]](https://openclaw.ai/)[[2]](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) It has exploded in popularity, boasting 181k GitHub stars just 19 days after major updates.[[2]](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)\n\n**Latest News (as of February 10, 2026):**  \n- **Major Security Exposures Reported (Feb 9):** SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team identified over 40,000 publicly exposed OpenClaw instances across 28,663 unique IPs in 76 countries, many due to misconfigurations like internet-exposed control panels and unsafe defaults. 63% are vulnerable, including 12,812 to remote code execution via three high-severity CVEs (CVSS 7.8-8.8) with public exploits, risking full host takeover, API key theft, and stealthy attacks masked as normal AI activity. Most exposures are in China, US, and Singapore; outdated versions are common despite patches.[[3]](https://siliconangle.com/2026/02/09/tens-thousands-openclaw-systems-exposed-due-misconfiguration-known-exploits)[[4]](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researchers-40000-exposed-openclaw) Recommendations include zero-trust access, least privilege, and monitoring agent prompts.[[4]](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researchers-40000-exposed-openclaw)  \n- **VirusTotal Partnership for Skill Scanning (Feb 9-10):** In response to malware and prompt injection in ClawHub skills, OpenClaw integrated VirusTotal scanning for all uploaded skills via SHA-256 hashes, though not foolproof against clever payloads.[[5]](https://cisoseries.com/cybersecurity-news-openclaw-embraces-virustotal-cisa-eol-deadline-ransomware-hits-bridgepay)[[1]](https://openclaw.ai/)  \n- **New Release (Feb 9):** Version 2026.2.9 was released, with security features like sandboxing via Docker and DM access controls emphasized.[[2]](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)  \n- **Community Buzz:** Hacker News and Reddit threads highlight both life-changing utility and architectural security risks (e.g., root access needs), with warnings about malware-laced skills and a \"security disaster\" from rapid 100k+ dev adoption.[[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46931805)[[7]](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qz6hgp/the_openclaw_security_disaster_what_happens_when)[[8]](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qxrogr/a_topdownloaded_openclaw_skill_is_actually_a) Earlier Jan vulnerabilities were patched, but exposures persist.[[9]](https://security.utoronto.ca/advisories/openclaw-vulnerability-notification)\n\nSecurity teams urge caution: treat agents as privileged identities and avoid public exposure.[[4]](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researchers-40000-exposed-openclaw) For more, check the GitHub repo or official site.[[2]](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)[[1]](https://openclaw.ai/)",
