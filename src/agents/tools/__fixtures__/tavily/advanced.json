While initially released for preview testing, it was made generally available in May 2025 alongside Claude 4. Enterprise adoption of Claude Code showed significant growth, with Anthropic reporting a 5.5x increase in Claude Code revenue by July. Anthropic released a web version that October as well as an iOS app. As of January 2026, it was widely considered the best AI coding assistant, when paired with Opus 4.5, with GPT-5.2 also showing significant improvement. Claude Code went viral during the winter holidays when people had time to experiment with it, including many non-programmers who used it for vibe coding. [...] #### Claude Opus 4.6\n\nAnthropic released Opus 4.6 on February 5, 2026. The main improvements included an agent team and Claude in PowerPoint.\n\n## Research\n\nIn May 2024, Anthropic issued a paper demonstrating mechanistic interpretability via a model which focused on the Golden Gate Bridge in a way the researchers compared to obsession, and another which composed scam emails.\n\nIn June 2025, Anthropic tested how Claude 3.7 Sonnet could run a vending machine in the company's office. The instance initially performed its assigned tasks, although poorly, until it eventually malfunctioned and insisted it was a human, contacted the company's security office, and attempted to fire human workers. In December 2025, the experiment continued with Sonnet 4.0 and 4.5. [...] ### Claude 4\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Anthropic released two more models: Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4. Anthropic added API features for developers: a code execution tool, \"connectors\" to external tools using its Model Context Protocol, and Files API. It classified Opus 4 as a \"Level 3\" model on the company's four-point safety scale, meaning they consider it so powerful that it poses \"significantly higher risk\". Anthropic reported that during a safety test involving a fictional scenario, Claude and other frontier LLMs often send a blackmail email to an engineer in order to prevent their replacement.\n\n#### Claude Opus 4.1",

With Anthropic’s release of Claude 4 in May of 2025, I was skeptical of their bet on code — I was distracted by the glitz of OpenAI and Gemini trading blows with announcements like models achieving IMO Gold medals in mathematics or other evaluation breakthroughs.\n\nAnthropic deserves serious credit for the focus of its vision. They were likely not the only AI lab to note the coming role of agents, but they were by far the first to shift their messaging and prioritization towards this. In my post in June of 2025, a month after Claude 4 was released, I was coming around to them being right to deprioritize standard benchmarks: [...] This is a different path for the industry and will take a different form of messaging than we’re used to. More releases are going to look like Anthropic’s Claude 4, where the benchmark gains are minor and the real world gains are a big step. There are plenty of more implications for policy, evaluation, and transparency that come with this. It is going to take much more nuance to understand if the pace of progress is continuing, especially as critics of AI are going to seize the opportunity of evaluations flatlining to say that AI is no longer working. [...] ### On comparing models in 2026.\n\nLast Thursday, February 5th, both OpenAI and Anthropic unveiled the next iterations of their models designed as coding assistants, GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, respectively. Ahead of this, Anthropic had a firm grasp of the mindshare as everyone collectively grappled with the new world of agents, primarily driven by a Claude Code with Opus 4.5-induced step change in performance. This post doesn’t unpack how software is changing forever, Moltbook is showcasing the future, ML research is accelerating, and the many broader implications, but rather how to assess, live with, and prepare for new models. The fine margins between Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.3 will be felt in many model versions this year, with Opus ahead in this matchup on usability.\n\nShare",

Sarah Sachs, Director of Artificial Intelligence at Notion, stated: “Claude Opus 4.6 is the most powerful model Anthropic has released. It handles complex requests successfully by breaking them into concrete steps, executing them and delivering flawless work even when the task is ambitious. For Notion users, it feels less like a tool and more like a competent collaborator.” [...] Meanwhile, Fabian Hedin, co-founder of Lovable, expressed: “Claude Opus 4.6 marks an improvement in design quality. It integrates seamlessly with our design systems and is more autonomous, which is fundamental for Lovable’s values. People should be creating things that matter, not micro-managing the AI.”\n\nIn addition, Paulo Arruda, Staff Engineer at Shopify, highlighted: “Claude Opus 4.6 is the best model from Anthropic we have tested. It understands intent with minimal prompting and exceeded all expectations by exploring and generating details that I did not even know I wanted until I saw them. I felt like I was working with the model, not waiting for it.”\n\n## Safety controls [...] Claude Opus 4.6 represents a significant qualitative leap compared to its previous version (Claude Opus 4.5), as it is capable of conducting a deeper reflection, providing greater attention to detail when planning, executing agent tasks over longer periods, operating more reliably on massive codebases, and detecting its own errors.",

What we know.\n\nHeadshot of a Black man\nAnthropic logo displayed on a phone screen and AI sign displayed on a screen\n\nRumors are swirling that Anthropic is close to releasing Claude Sonnet 5, a new version of its mid-tier AI model that could significantly shift the competitive landscape for large language models.\n\nMultiple reports published in early February suggest Claude Sonnet 5 is imminent, with some industry watchers pointing to signs of internal testing and quiet rollout preparation. While Anthropic has not formally announced a release date, speculation intensified after developers and analysts began referencing \"Sonnet 5\" in public forums and social posts. [...] According to UCStrategies\"), Claude Sonnet 5 is expected to deliver major performance gains while maintaining the pricing structure that has made Sonnet attractive to developers. The outlet reports that the model may match or exceed the capabilities of Anthropic’s higher-end Opus 4.5 model while remaining significantly cheaper to run, a combination that could make it especially appealing for enterprise and coding workloads. [...] Cost efficiency appears to be a central theme. Coverage from Geeky Gadgets\") suggests Sonnet 5 could cost roughly half as much as Opus 4.5, while offering faster inference and stronger agent-style capabilities, including improved context retention and multitasking. That positions the model as a direct challenger not just to Anthropic’s own lineup, but also to OpenAI's and Google’s upcoming releases.\n\nThere are also rumors that Claude Sonnet 5 will deepen its integration with Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused environment. Several analysts cited by UCStrategies speculate that the model could outperform Opus in coding tasks, particularly in long-running workflows that benefit from sustained context and structured reasoning.\n\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nHeadshot of a Black man",

The news about Opus 4.6 signaled to them that AI was officially on the brink of radically transforming software development and security testing.

We need exposure prioritization, contextual risk analysis, and AI-driven remediation to transform findings into security outcomes.\n\n## Key takeaways [...] Indeed, Opus 4.6 represents an acceleration of a long-standing trend. Every year, the security industry introduces new tools that uncover more vulnerabilities more quickly. Combined with prior advances in AI-driven vulnerability discovery, including Google Project Zero, the Anthropic team has taken a major step forward, and we’re excited about the vulnerability discovery capabilities of Opus 4.6.",
