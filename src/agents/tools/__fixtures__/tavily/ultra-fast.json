        "content": "Anthropic releases its 'smartest' AI model. Anthropic releases its 'smartest' AI model. OpenAI rival Anthropic on Monday released what it said is its smartest artificial intelligence model to date, particularly when it comes to computer coding. Anthropic's new model is \"much stronger at coding, and particularly at taking over and doing really complicated coding tests,\" Anthropic co-founder and chief science officer Jared Kaplan told AFP. Aside from overall improved intelligence, the latest iteration of Claude has a \"hybrid\" reasoning model that lets users get quick answers to questions or have it spend time mulling complex queries and share steps in the process, according to Kaplan. The new AI model makes its debut as Anthropic works on finalizing a $3.5 billion funding round that values the startup at $61.5 billion in a huge leap from its prior valuation, according to a Wall Street Journal report. AI models have moved beyond generating images, videos or written works to providing \"agents\" specializing in fields or tasks. OpenAI released a version of ChatGPT about six months ago that shared its \"thinking\" process, but Anthropic followed that by enabling its Claude model to command computers as people do. **Citation**: Anthropic releases its 'smartest' AI model (2025, February 24) retrieved 5 February 2026 from.

The first months of 2026 have already delivered another round of escalation in the frontier-model race. OpenAI released GPT-5.3 Codex, the latest evolution of its developer-focused coding agent, while Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6, a broader reasoning- and enterprise-workflow model pushing scale and context limits. Although they are often compared as peers, they target slightly different philosophies: Codex leans deeply into autonomous software engineering execution, while Opus emphasizes long-context reasoning, multi-task productivity, and enterprise workflows. Understanding their relative strengths requires looking beyond headlines into architecture intent, capabilities, and positioning. ## Product positioning and intent. GPT-5.3 Codex represents OpenAI’s continued investment in agentic coding infrastructure, AI that works alongside developers or independently executes engineering tasks. Codex models are optimized specifically for software engineering workflows, rather than general reasoning. GPT-5-Codex variants are trained for real-world development work, capable of both interactive editing and long autonomous execution on complex projects. ## Published in Neural Notions. ·Last published 2 days ago.

Anthropic unveils latest AI model as OpenAI rivalry intensifies. Anthropic on Thursday released its latest high-performing artificial intelligence model, escalating its challenge to OpenAI and Google in the intensifying AI race. Founded by former OpenAI staffers in 2021, Anthropic has gained significant momentum in recent months with a series of product releases that have impressed Silicon Valley -- and rattled Wall Street. Releases including an AI automation tool and a legal field product contributed this week to a broad selloff in software stocks, as they exacerbated concerns that AI models can replace the utility of stand-alone business apps and platforms. While its archrival OpenAI targets consumers directly with the hugely popular ChatGPT, Anthropic appeals to computer coders and enterprises seeking AI products that prioritize data security and predictability alongside raw performance. Anthropic says its latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, represents a fundamental shift in how AI handles complex workplace tasks. The company highlighted use cases including financial modeling that synthesizes complicated regulatory filings and market data, plus document and presentation outputs that require minimal refinement. \"Claude Opus 4.6 gets much closer to production-ready quality on the first try than what we've seen with any model,\" Anthropic said, adding that deliverables will require \"less back-and-forth\" to finalize. Like OpenAI, Anthropic remains far from profitability. Anthropic has publicly committed to keeping its Claude chatbot ad-free, calling advertisements \"incongruous\" with the personal nature of user conversations. Anthropic relies instead on enterprise deals and paid subscriptions for revenue, a distinction it's highlighting in its first Super Bowl ad campaign airing this weekend. According to US media reports, Anthropic is planning a tender offer for its staff that would value the company at approximately $350 billion -- staggering growth for a four-year-old company but below OpenAI's reported target valuation of $800 billion in its next fundraising round.
