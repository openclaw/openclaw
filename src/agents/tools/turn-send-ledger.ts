/**
 * Per-turn, per-target outbound send ledger shared by the `message` and
 * `conversations_send` tools.
 *
 * The loop detector hashes full tool params (tool-loop-detection.ts), so a model
 * that re-sends the same answer with slightly reworded text produces a distinct
 * hash every time and is invisible to it. This ledger counts *successful*
 * deliveries per (turn, target) so a tool can nudge the model — or, when an
 * operator opts in, cap the fan-out — independently of the loop detector and its
 * default-off switch.
 *
 * State is module-level and keyed by (agent session, run), mirroring the reviewed
 * `recentPollVoteBySession` precedent in message-tool.ts: a per-tool-instance
 * counter would be lost across the run boundary that separates the tool calls in
 * one turn, so the count must outlive the instance. A "turn" is one agent run
 * (`runId`), so each entry is scoped to one (session, run) pair and stays
 * authoritative for the run's whole lifetime — including long tool waits and
 * provider fallback attempts that reuse the runId — so the opt-in hard cap holds
 * for the entire turn as documented (docs/tools/loop-detection.md,
 * schema.help.runtime.ts). The logical-run owner deletes the slot at its terminal
 * boundary (clearTurnSendLedgerForRun, wired from the fallback-chain `finally` in
 * embedded-agent-runner/run-entry.ts); a run that has no entry starts fresh.
 * Concurrent foreground runs can share one sessionKey (see
 * src/auto-reply/dispatch.freshness.test.ts), so the runId is part of the key
 * rather than a field that resets a shared slot — otherwise a later run would
 * evict an earlier still-live run's counts.
