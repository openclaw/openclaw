/**
 * Extra bootstrap file glob resolution.
 *
 * Resolves `**\/AGENTS.md`-style extra-bootstrap patterns with Node's async
 * `fs.promises.glob`, which awaits per-directory lstat/readdir and keeps the
 * event loop live during embedded_run bootstrap-context. fs.glob owns matching
 * (dot rules, platform case, `..`, literal-named directory symlinks); this
 * module only filters each match to a workspace-contained realpath, a boundary
 * fs.glob does not enforce, so out-of-workspace bootstrap content never reaches
 * the prompt.
 *
 * fs.glob is absent on some runtimes (older Node, certain Bun builds). A narrow
 * capability fallback resolves the same pattern with a local Minimatch directory
 * walk there, so a configured glob still loads its files instead of throwing
 * into the loader's `io` diagnostic and dropping the whole configured set. The
 * fallback triggers only when the API is unavailable — a real fs.glob error
 * still surfaces — and its matches pass through the same realpath containment
 * filter as the fs.glob path.
