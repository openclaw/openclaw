# Baseline Audit — Wave 0

- Date: 2026-02-19
- Scope: Mission Control (`apps/dashboard`)
- Generated by: `npm run audit:baseline`

## Summary
This document tracks baseline quality metrics before and during Wave 0 governance lock.
Values are generated into `output/playwright/baseline-audit.json` and summarized here.

## Required baseline areas
1. API success/error matrix by endpoint.
2. Gateway connection stability probe.
3. Chat response timing distribution.
4. Scroll invariants for board/chat/agents on desktop and mobile.
5. CI gate status snapshot.

## Current snapshot (latest run)
- Source: `output/playwright/baseline-audit.json`
- Generated at: `2026-02-19T03:07:22.694Z`
- Workspace: `golden`
- Scroll audit details: `output/playwright/audit-scroll-chat-results.json`

### API success/error matrix (3 probes each)
- `/api/tasks?workspace_id=golden`: `200,200,200` (`p50=3ms`, `p95=9ms`)
- `/api/missions?workspace_id=golden`: `200,200,200` (`p50=3ms`, `p95=4ms`)
- `/api/agents`: `200,200,200` (`p50=2ms`, `p95=5ms`)
- `/api/openclaw/status`: `200,200,200` (`p50=3ms`, `p95=3ms`)
- `/api/openclaw/usage?period=today`: `200,200,200` (`p50=2ms`, `p95=3ms`)
- `/api/chat/sessions?limit=10`: `200,200,200` (`p50=3ms`, `p95=4ms`)

### Gateway stability
- Probes: `8`
- Connected: `8`
- Disconnected: `0`

### Chat latency
- Samples: `5`
- Statuses: `202,202,202,202,202`
- `p50=13ms`
- `p95=39ms`

### Scroll invariants
- Scenarios: `6` (board/chat/agents on desktop + mobile)
- `document` scroll takeover: not detected
- Header pinned (`top=0` before/after): pass
- Chat composer visibility in long-scroll context: pass

## Open risks
1. Provider quotas/keys still vary by environment; degraded responses prevent crashes but not model-quality loss.
2. Baseline scripts depend on workspace-aware endpoint probes; route contract changes must be reflected in audit scripts immediately.
3. Existing large working tree still increases merge risk; CI gates must remain mandatory.

## Delta from prior run
1. Updated baseline API probes to include required `workspace_id` for tasks and missions, restoring accurate pass/fail telemetry.
2. Revalidated scroll/chat invariants after reinstalling local Playwright browser binaries and rerunning `audit:scroll-chat`.
3. Maintained 100% API success and stable gateway connectivity across all baseline probes.

## Next updates
Update this file after each milestone wave with:
1. Delta vs previous baseline.
2. Regressions introduced/resolved.
3. Risk changes and mitigations.
