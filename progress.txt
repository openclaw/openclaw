Task: TEST: installatie check
Started: Thursday, February 12th, 2026 — 5:32 PM

## Codebase Patterns
- Commands are in `src/commands/` directory
- Tests use vitest with `describe`, `it`, `expect` patterns
- Tests are co-located with source files (e.g., `check.ts` has `check.test.ts`)
- Build uses `pnpm build` (tsdown/rolldown bundler)
- Tests run with `pnpm test <path>` (parallel test runner)
- Use `@clack/prompts` for CLI UX
- Runtime abstraction for logging: `RuntimeEnv` with `log`, `error`, `warn`, `debug`, `exit`

## 2026-02-12 - US-002: Implement Node.js and pnpm version checks
- Implemented version checking functions: `parseVersion`, `compareVersions`, `checkNodeVersion`, `checkPnpmVersion`
- Added `node-version` and `pnpm-version` checks to the installation check command
- Added comprehensive unit tests for version parsing and comparison
- Build passes, all tests pass

**Files changed:**
- `src/commands/check.ts` - Added version check functions and integrated into runInstallationChecks
- `src/commands/check.test.ts` - Added tests for version parsing, comparison, and version checks

**Learnings:**
- parseVersion needs to handle empty strings explicitly (returns null for `''` since `Number('') === 0`)
- pnpm check uses `execSync` with timeout, graceful error handling for missing pnpm
- Version comparison uses numeric array comparison with padded zeros for different lengths
