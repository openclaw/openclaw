1,EPIC-V0-COMPLETE,V0-BOOTSTRAP,Story,P0,READY,,"Product Architect,DevOps,PM",Sprint V0-1,"Lock v0 readiness and reproducibility before all feature work","`pnpm dispatch:demo:stack`, bootstrap, and status checks are documented and repeatable; one clean restart returns a known baseline and emits deterministic fixture IDs for every planning run."
2,EPIC-V0-COMPLETE,V0-WORKER-LAUNCH,Story,P0,READY,V0-BOOTSTRAP,"Backend Engineer,SRE,PM",Sprint V0-1,"Replace placeholder worker with a real job loop before production handoff","Worker executes one idempotent background workflow and logs heartbeat + failures; worker health is visible in logs and runbooks and includes safe shutdown behavior."
3,EPIC-GZ-01,GLZ-01,Story,P0,READY,V0-BOOTSTRAP,"Product Architect,Intake Agent,Backend Architect",Sprint V0-1,"Build command-driven blind intake endpoint and required-field schema for customer identity, location, and issue classification","Create ticket in triaged or schedulable state only when required fields are complete; reject weak identities with escalation flag; emit audit event plus timeline entry; require tests for happy path and required-field failures"
4,EPIC-GZ-01,GLZ-02,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-01,"Data Architect,Backend Engineer",Sprint V0-1,"Normalize addresses and deduplicate jobs by account, site, issue signature; prevent accidental duplicates on same caller and location","Canonical case identity key returns stable idempotency for repeated blind submissions; duplicate detector preserves original ticket and writes linkage event; no duplicate open cases for identical payload within threshold"
5,EPIC-GZ-01,GLZ-03,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-02,"Product Architect,Scheduling Agent",Sprint V0-1,"Move high-confidence intake tickets to schedulable with required follow-up prompt set and state transition auditability","A ticket from triaged to schedulable only happens when classification and contact confidence pass policy; invalid transitions are rejected with explicit reason and correlation id"
6,EPIC-GZ-02,GLZ-04,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-03,"Operations Architect,Scheduling Agent",Sprint V0-2,"Introduce dispatch queue prioritization by region, urgency, promised response SLA, and glass-risk class","Queue ordering is deterministic and explainable; emergency and safety-critical incidents are prioritized above normal jobs; starvation controls visible in timeline"
7,EPIC-GZ-02,GLZ-05,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-04,"Principal Backend Engineer,SRE",Sprint V0-2,"Implement assignment recommendation using technician certifications, zone mapping, route adjacency, and open load","Dispatch command emits assignment suggestion and selected assignment; assignment without required technician capability or mismatch with area and service type is rejected with policy failure and audit event"
8,EPIC-GZ-02,GLZ-06,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-05,"Security Engineer,Scheduling Agent",Sprint V0-2,"Add customer confirmation and commitment transitions with reschedule/cancel branches and immutable proof hooks","Appointment confirmation transitions only through approved command path; stale confirmations auto-expire to required follow-up; every commitment or reschedule action writes immutable action record and timeline evidence"
9,EPIC-V0-COMPLETE,V0-E2E-LOCK,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-06,"QA Lead,DevOps,PM",Sprint V0-2,"Create one-command command-chain proof for the full v0 flow","Single script executes intake to closeout with deterministic success/failure output and required negative cases including policy violations and stale state transitions"
10,EPIC-GZ-03,GLZ-07,Story,P0,READY,V0-E2E-LOCK,"Principal Backend Engineer,Technician Liaison",Sprint V0-3,"Implement dispatcher and technician job packet lifecycle updates for dispatched to onsite to closeout_pending","check-in, notes, parts, labor, and timeline updates are accepted only by technician role; unauthorized role transitions are denied and logged as policy events"
11,EPIC-GZ-03,GLZ-08,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-07,"Security/Compliance Engineer,Technician Liaison",Sprint V0-3,"Enforce evidence bundle schema for photo, notes, labor, parts, signature and closeout readiness","Closeout is blocked if required evidence is missing; explicit reason is returned; operator receives actionable escalation task; partial progress can remain closeout_pending when minimum evidence passes gates"
12,EPIC-GZ-03,GLZ-09,Story,P1,READY,GLZ-08,"Product Architect,Automation Lead",Sprint V0-3,"Add blind closeout candidate heuristics with escalation triggers for ambiguity and risk","Low-risk jobs can produce closeout candidate automatically while high-risk jobs require manual closeout approval; every auto-close attempt is logged with justification and evidence scope"
13,EPIC-GZ-04,GLZ-10,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-09,"Principal Backend Engineer,Dispatch Operations",Sprint V0-4,"Generate invoice draft artifacts with labor, travel, materials, tax, and status checks from evidence events","Invoice draft is generated only when closeout evidence and signature gates pass; draft references ticket audit id and is immutable except via explicit revision request"
14,EPIC-GZ-04,GLZ-11,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-10,"SRE/Platform Engineer,Security Engineer",Sprint V0-4,"Build production control dashboard and alerting including missed SLA, escalation spikes, missing proof, and override usage","Dashboard shows real-time state counts by role and urgency; alerts include owner and severity; noise is controlled via threshold and dedupe; on-call drill validates escalation routing"
15,EPIC-GZ-04,GLZ-12,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-11,"Product Architect,Principal Backend Engineer",Sprint V0-4,"Create rollout controls for operator override, autonomy pause, rollback, and retention for incident replay","One runbook operation disables autonomous actions by incident type; rollback restores manual mode without timeline loss; all evidence/replay artifacts remain retrievable for review"
16,EPIC-V0-COMPLETE,V0-LAUNCH-GATE,Story,P0,READY,GLZ-10|GLZ-11|GLZ-12|V0-WORKER-LAUNCH|V0-E2E-LOCK,"PM,SRE,QA,Product Architect",Sprint V0-4,"Declare v0 pilot-ready with hard gates and release packet","All v0 core stories pass; command-chain evidence bundle is complete; runbooks and rollback drills are validated; no open P0 blockers before pilot window"
