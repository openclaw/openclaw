# Closeout SOP — Verification + Invoice Readiness

## Verification (QA/dispatcher)
- Confirm required evidence exists for incident type template
- Confirm completion notes include tests performed
- Confirm signature/no-signature reason present
- If anomalies (high time-on-site, missing parts list), flag for QA audit

## Invoice readiness
- Labor time + rate rule applied
- Parts used recorded
- NTE/approval trail complete (if changes)
- Customer contact and site info verified

## If fail
- Reject verification with reason and required remediation (missing photo, unclear notes)
- Ticket remains COMPLETED_PENDING_VERIFICATION until resolved
