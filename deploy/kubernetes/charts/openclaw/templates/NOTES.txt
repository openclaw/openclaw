1. Get the OpenClaw gateway URL by running:

  kubectl get svc {{ include "openclaw.fullname" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. The gateway exposes two ports:
   * {{ .Values.service.ports.gateway }} (primary API)
   * {{ .Values.service.ports.bridge }} (bridge/tunnel)

3. Provide your gateway token and any model credentials via a Secret. You can either:
   * Supply values under `secret.stringData` and keep them in git-ignored files, or
   * Reference an existing secret using `secret.name` and disable secret creation.

4. Your workspace and configuration live under `/home/node/.openclaw`. Make sure the
   associated PersistentVolumeClaims have enough capacity for downloaded skills,
   memory snapshots, and gateways logs.
