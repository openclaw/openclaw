# SEO Gap Exploiter

Find keywords your competitors rank for that you don't. Generate content to fill every gap. Drive organic traffic fast.

## Workflow

1. **Sitemap Analysis**: Fetch your sitemap and competitor sitemaps
2. **Keyword Research**: Extract keywords from competitor pages via web search
3. **Gap Identification**: Find keywords they rank for that you don't have content for
4. **Content Generation**: Create optimized articles for each gap
5. **Publishing**: Push content to your site (via GitHub, CMS API, or file output)
6. **Monitoring**: Track ranking changes over 2-4 weeks

## Step 1: Competitor Analysis

### Fetch Competitor Sitemaps

```
https://competitor.com/sitemap.xml
https://competitor.com/sitemap_index.xml
```

Extract all URLs and categorize by:

- Blog posts / articles
- Product/feature pages
- Landing pages
- Comparison pages
- Integration pages

### Identify Their Content Strategy

For each competitor, map:

- Topic clusters they cover
- Long-tail keywords they target
- Content formats (listicles, tutorials, comparisons, guides)
- Publishing frequency
- Most linked-to pages

## Step 2: Keyword Gap Analysis

### Finding Gaps

Use web search to discover what competitors rank for:

```
site:competitor.com "[keyword phrase]"
"competitor.com" + "[topic]" inurl:blog
```

Cross-reference against your own sitemap. Any topic they cover that you don't = gap.

### Gap Prioritization

| Priority | Criteria                                                | Action            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| P0       | High volume + low difficulty + direct product relevance | Write immediately |
| P1       | Medium volume + product adjacent                        | Write this week   |
| P2       | Low volume but high intent (bottom of funnel)           | Write this month  |
| P3       | Informational only, low intent                          | Backlog           |

Focus on P0 and P1 first.

## Step 3: Content Generation
