## Automation (DNA)

### Step 1: Search for a skill

```bash
npx @thesethrose/skills-search "react"
```

### Step 2: Install found skill via skills CLI

After finding a skill, install it using the `skills` CLI:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

**TUI Navigation Guidance:**

The `skills` CLI uses an interactive menu. Watch for prompts and navigate accordingly:

1. **Select skills** → Toggle skills you want with `space`, confirm with `enter`
2. **Select agents** → Navigate with `up`/`down`, select `DNA` with `space`, confirm with `enter`
3. **Installation scope** → Choose Project (recommended) with `enter`
4. **Confirm** → Press `enter` to proceed

**Important:** The TUI may change. Pay attention to the menu options and select `DNA` when prompted for agents. If unsure about any selection, ask the user for guidance.

### Step 3: Verify installation

```bash
ls ~/.dna/workspace/.agents/skills/
```

## Adding Your Own Skill

Skills.sh automatically indexes GitHub repos containing `SKILL.md` files. To add your skill:

1. **Create a skill folder** with `SKILL.md` in your GitHub repo
2. **Publish to ClawdHub** for DNA-specific discovery:
   ```bash
   clawdhub publish ./your-skill/ --slug your-skill --name "Your Skill" --version 1.0.0
   ```
3. **Install in DNA:**
   ```bash
   clawdhub install your-skill
   ```

## Notes

- Queries https://skills.sh/api/skills (official skills.sh API)
- Results sorted by install count (most popular first)
- **DNA-only**: Install via `clawdhub install skills-search`
- Skills.sh leaderboard requires GitHub repo (not needed for ClawdHub-only skills)
