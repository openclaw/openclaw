/**
 * A generated module for ClawdCi functions
 *
 * This module has been generated via dagger init and serves as a reference to
 * basic module structure as you get started with Dagger.
 *
 * Two functions have been pre-created. You can modify, delete, or add to them,
 * as needed. They demonstrate usage of arguments and return types using simple
 * echo and grep commands. The functions can be called from the dagger CLI or
 * from one of the SDKs.
 *
 * The first line in this comment block is a short description line and the
 * rest is a long description with more detail on the module's purpose or usage,
 * if appropriate. All modules should have a short description.
