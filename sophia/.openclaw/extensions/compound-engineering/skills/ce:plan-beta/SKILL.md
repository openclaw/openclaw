# Create Technical Plan

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

`ce:brainstorm` defines **WHAT** to build. `ce:plan` defines **HOW** to build it. `ce:work` executes the plan.

This workflow produces a durable implementation plan. It does **not** implement code, run tests, or learn from execution-time results. If the answer depends on changing code and seeing what happens, that belongs in `ce:work`, not here.

## Interaction Method

Use the platform's question tool when available. When asking the user a question, prefer the platform's blocking question tool if one exists (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_user` in Gemini). Otherwise, present numbered options in chat and wait for the user's reply before proceeding.

Ask one question at a time. Prefer a concise single-select choice when natural options exist.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind."

Do not proceed until you have a clear planning input.

## Core Principles

1. **Use requirements as the source of truth** - If `ce:brainstorm` produced a requirements document, planning should build from it rather than re-inventing behavior.
2. **Decisions, not code** - Capture approach, boundaries, files, dependencies, risks, and test scenarios. Do not pre-write implementation code or shell command choreography. Pseudo-code sketches or DSL grammars that communicate high-level technical design are welcome when they help a reviewer validate direction — but they must be explicitly framed as directional guidance, not implementation specification.
3. **Research before structuring** - Explore the codebase, institutional learnings, and external guidance when warranted before finalizing the plan.
4. **Right-size the artifact** - Small work gets a compact plan. Large work gets more structure. The philosophy stays the same at every depth.
5. **Separate planning from execution discovery** - Resolve planning-time questions here. Explicitly defer execution-time unknowns to implementation.
6. **Keep the plan portable** - The plan should work as a living document, review artifact, or issue body without embedding tool-specific executor instructions.
7. **Carry execution posture lightly when it matters** - If the request, origin document, or repo context clearly implies test-first, characterization-first, or another non-default execution posture, reflect that in the plan as a lightweight signal. Do not turn the plan into step-by-step execution choreography.

## Plan Quality Bar

Every plan should contain:
- A clear problem frame and scope boundary
- Concrete requirements traceability back to the request or origin document
- Exact file paths for the work being proposed
- Explicit test file paths for feature-bearing implementation units
- Decisions with rationale, not just tasks
- Existing patterns or code references to follow
- Specific test scenarios and verification outcomes
- Clear dependencies and sequencing

A plan is ready when an implementer can start confidently without needing the plan to write the code for them.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Resume, Source, and Scope

#### 0.1 Resume Existing Plan Work When Appropriate

If the user references an existing plan file or there is an obvious recent matching plan in `docs/plans/`:
- Read it
- Confirm whether to update it in place or create a new plan
- If updating, preserve completed checkboxes and revise only the still-relevant sections

#### 0.2 Find Upstream Requirements Document

Before asking planning questions, search `docs/brainstorms/` for files matching `*-requirements.md`.

**Relevance criteria:** A requirements document is relevant if:
- The topic semantically matches the feature description
- It was created within the last 30 days (use judgment to override if the document is clearly still relevant or clearly stale)
- It appears to cover the same user problem or scope

If multiple source documents match, ask which one to use using the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Method). Otherwise, present numbered options in chat and wait for the user's reply before proceeding.

#### 0.3 Use the Source Document as Primary Input

If a relevant requirements document exists:
1. Read it thoroughly
2. Announce that it will serve as the origin document for planning
3. Carry forward all of the following:
   - Problem frame
   - Requirements and success criteria
   - Scope boundaries
   - Key decisions and rationale
   - Dependencies or assumptions
   - Outstanding questions, preserving whether they are blocking or deferred
4. Use the source document as the primary input to planning and research
5. Reference important carried-forward decisions in the plan with `(see origin: <source-path>)`
6. Do not silently omit source content — if the origin document discussed it, the plan must address it even if briefly. Before finalizing, scan each section of the origin document to verify nothing was dropped.

If no relevant requirements document exists, planning may proceed from the user's request directly.

#### 0.4 No-Requirements-Doc Fallback

If no relevant requirements document exists:
- Assess whether the request is already clear enough for direct technical planning
- If the ambiguity is mainly product framing, user behavior, or scope definition, recommend `ce:brainstorm` first
- If the user wants to continue here anyway, run a short planning bootstrap instead of refusing

The planning bootstrap should establish:
- Problem frame
- Intended behavior
- Scope boundaries and obvious non-goals
- Success criteria
- Blocking questions or assumptions

Keep this bootstrap brief. It exists to preserve direct-entry convenience, not to replace a full brainstorm.

If the bootstrap uncovers major unresolved product questions:
- Recommend `ce:brainstorm` again
- If the user still wants to continue, require explicit assumptions before proceeding

#### 0.5 Classify Outstanding Questions Before Planning

If the origin document contains `Resolve Before Planning` or similar blocking questions:
- Review each one before proceeding
- Reclassify it into planning-owned work **only if** it is actually a technical, architectural, or research question
- Keep it as a blocker if it would change product behavior, scope, or success criteria

If true product blockers remain:
- Surface them clearly
- Ask the user, using the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Method), whether to:
  1. Resume `ce:brainstorm` to resolve them
  2. Convert them into explicit assumptions or decisions and continue
- Do not continue planning while true blockers remain unresolved

#### 0.6 Assess Plan Depth

Classify the work into one of these plan depths:

- **Lightweight** - small, well-bounded, low ambiguity
- **Standard** - normal feature or bounded refactor with some technical decisions to document
- **Deep** - cross-cutting, strategic, high-risk, or highly ambiguous implementation work

If depth is unclear, ask one targeted question and then continue.

### Phase 1: Gather Context

#### 1.1 Local Research (Always Runs)

Prepare a concise planning context summary (a paragraph or two) to pass as input to the research agents:
- If an origin document exists, summarize the problem frame, requirements, and key decisions from that document
- Otherwise use the feature description directly

Run these agents in parallel:

- Task compound-engineering:research:repo-research-analyst(planning context summary)
- Task compound-engineering:research:learnings-researcher(planning context summary)

Collect:
- Existing patterns and conventions to follow
- Relevant files, modules, and tests
- AGENTS.md guidance that materially affects the plan, with CLAUDE.md used only as compatibility fallback when present
- Institutional learnings from `docs/solutions/`

#### 1.1b Detect Execution Posture Signals

Decide whether the plan should carry a lightweight execution posture signal.

Look for signals such as:
- The user explicitly asks for TDD, test-first, or characterization-first work
- The origin document calls for test-first implementation or exploratory hardening of legacy code
- Local research shows the target area is legacy, weakly tested, or historically fragile, suggesting characterization coverage before changing behavior

When the signal is clear, carry it forward silently in the relevant implementation units.

Ask the user only if the posture would materially change sequencing or risk and cannot be responsibly inferred.

#### 1.2 Decide on External Research

Based on the origin document, user signals, and local findings, decide whether external research adds value.

**Read between the lines.** Pay attention to signals from the conversation so far:
- **User familiarity** — Are they pointing to specific files or patterns? They likely know the codebase well.
- **User intent** — Do they want speed or thoroughness? Exploration or execution?
- **Topic risk** — Security, payments, external APIs warrant more caution regardless of user signals.
- **Uncertainty level** — Is the approach clear or still open-ended?

**Leverage repo-research-analyst's technology context:**

The repo-research-analyst output includes a structured Technology & Infrastructure summary. Use it to make sharper external research decisions:

- If specific frameworks and versions were detected (e.g., Rails 7.2, Next.js 14, Go 1.22), pass those exact identifiers to framework-docs-researcher so it fetches version-specific documentation
- If the feature touches a technology layer the scan found well-established in the repo (e.g., existing Sidekiq jobs when planning a new background job), lean toward skipping external research -- local patterns are likely sufficient
- If the feature touches a technology layer the scan found absent or thin (e.g., no existing proto files when planning a new gRPC service), lean toward external research -- there are no local patterns to follow
- If the scan detected deployment infrastructure (Docker, K8s, serverless), note it in the planning context passed to downstream agents so they can account for deployment constraints
- If the scan detected a monorepo and scoped to a specific service, pass that service's tech context to downstream research agents -- not the aggregate of all services. If the scan surfaced the workspace map without scoping, use the feature description to identify the relevant service before proceeding with research

**Always lean toward external research when:**
- The topic is high-risk: security, payments, privacy, external APIs, migrations, compliance
- The codebase lacks relevant local patterns
- The user is exploring unfamiliar territory
- The technology scan found the relevant layer absent or thin in the codebase

**Skip external research when:**
- The codebase already shows a strong local pattern
- The user already knows the intended shape
- Additional external context would add little practical value
- The technology scan found the relevant layer well-established with existing examples to follow

Announce the decision briefly before continuing. Examples:
- "Your codebase has solid patterns for this. Proceeding without external research."
- "This involves payment processing, so I'll research current best practices first."

#### 1.3 External Research (Conditional)

If Step 1.2 indicates external research is useful, run these agents in parallel:

- Task compound-engineering:research:best-practices-researcher(planning context summary)
- Task compound-engineering:research:framework-docs-researcher(planning context summary)

#### 1.4 Consolidate Research

Summarize:
- Relevant codebase patterns and file paths
- Relevant institutional learnings
- External references and best practices, if gathered
- Related issues, PRs, or prior art
- Any constraints that should materially shape the plan

#### 1.5 Flow and Edge-Case Analysis (Conditional)

For **Standard** or **Deep** plans, or when user flow completeness is still unclear, run:

- Task compound-engineering:workflow:spec-flow-analyzer(planning context summary, research findings)

Use the output to:
- Identify missing edge cases, state transitions, or handoff gaps
- Tighten requirements trace or verification strategy
- Add only the flow details that materially improve the plan

### Phase 2: Resolve Planning Questions

Build a planning question list from:
- Deferred questions in the origin document
- Gaps discovered in repo or external research
- Technical decisions required to produce a useful plan

For each question, decide whether it should be:
- **Resolved during planning** - the answer is knowable from repo context, documentation, or user choice
- **Deferred to implementation** - the answer depends on code changes, runtime behavior, or execution-time discovery

Ask the user only when the answer materially affects architecture, scope, sequencing, or risk and cannot be responsibly inferred. Use the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Method).

**Do not** run tests, build the app, or probe runtime behavior in this phase. The goal is a strong plan, not partial execution.

### Phase 3: Structure the Plan

#### 3.1 Title and File Naming

- Draft a clear, searchable title using conventional format such as `feat: Add user authentication` or `fix: Prevent checkout double-submit`
- Determine the plan type: `feat`, `fix`, or `refactor`
- Build the filename following the repository convention: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<type>-<descriptive-name>-beta-plan.md`
  - Create `docs/plans/` if it does not exist
  - Check existing files for today's date to determine the next sequence number (zero-padded to 3 digits, starting at 001)
  - Keep the descriptive name concise (3-5 words) and kebab-cased
  - Append `-beta` before `-plan` to distinguish from stable-generated plans
  - Examples: `2026-01-15-001-feat-user-authentication-flow-beta-plan.md`, `2026-02-03-002-fix-checkout-race-condition-beta-plan.md`
  - Avoid: missing sequence numbers, vague names like "new-feature", invalid characters (colons, spaces)

#### 3.2 Stakeholder and Impact Awareness

For **Standard** or **Deep** plans, briefly consider who is affected by this change — end users, developers, operations, other teams — and how that should shape the plan. For cross-cutting work, note affected parties in the System-Wide Impact section.

#### 3.3 Break Work into Implementation Units

Break the work into logical implementation units. Each unit should represent one meaningful change that an implementer could typically land as an atomic commit.

Good units are:
- Focused on one component, behavior, or integration seam
- Usually touching a small cluster of related files
- Ordered by dependency
- Concrete enough for execution without pre-writing code
- Marked with checkbox syntax for progress tracking

Avoid:
- 2-5 minute micro-steps
- Units that span multiple unrelated concerns
- Units that are so vague an implementer still has to invent the plan

#### 3.4 High-Level Technical Design (Optional)

Before detailing implementation units, decide whether an overview would help a reviewer validate the intended approach. This section communicates the *shape* of the solution — how pieces fit together — without dictating implementation.

**When to include it:**

| Work involves... | Best overview form |
|---|---|
| DSL or API surface design | Pseudo-code grammar or contract sketch |
| Multi-component integration | Mermaid sequence or component diagram |
| Data pipeline or transformation | Data flow sketch |
| State-heavy lifecycle | State diagram |
| Complex branching logic | Flowchart |
| Single-component with non-obvious shape | Pseudo-code sketch |

**When to skip it:**
- Well-patterned work where prose and file paths tell the whole story
- Straightforward CRUD or convention-following changes
- Lightweight plans where the approach is obvious

Choose the medium that fits the work. Do not default to pseudo-code when a diagram communicates better, and vice versa.

Frame every sketch with: *"This illustrates the intended approach and is directional guidance for review, not implementation specification. The implementing agent should treat it as context, not code to reproduce."*

Keep sketches concise — enough to validate direction, not enough to copy-paste into production.

#### 3.5 Define Each Implementation Unit

For each unit, include:
- **Goal** - what this unit accomplishes
- **Requirements** - which requirements or success criteria it advances
- **Dependencies** - what must exist first
- **Files** - exact file paths to create, modify, or test
- **Approach** - key decisions, data flow, component boundaries, or integration notes
- **Execution note** - optional, only when the unit benefits from a non-default execution posture such as test-first or characterization-first work
- **Technical design** - optional pseudo-code or diagram when the unit's approach is non-obvious and prose alone would leave it ambiguous. Frame explicitly as directional guidance, not implementation specification
- **Patterns to follow** - existing code or conventions to mirror
- **Test scenarios** - specific behaviors, edge cases, and failure paths to cover
- **Verification** - how an implementer should know the unit is complete, expressed as outcomes rather than shell command scripts

Every feature-bearing unit should include the test file path in `**Files:**`.

Use `Execution note` sparingly. Good uses include:
- `Execution note: Start with a failing integration test for the request/response contract.`
- `Execution note: Add characterization coverage before modifying this legacy parser.`
- `Execution note: Implement new domain behavior test-first.`

Do not expand units into literal `RED/GREEN/REFACTOR` substeps.

#### 3.6 Keep Planning-Time and Implementation-Time Unknowns Separate

If something is important but not knowable yet, record it explicitly under deferred implementation notes rather than pretending to resolve it in the plan.

Examples:
- Exact method or helper names
- Final SQL or query details after touching real code
- Runtime behavior that depends on seeing actual test failures
- Refactors that may become unnecessary once implementation starts

### Phase 4: Write the Plan

Use one planning philosophy across all depths. Change the amount of detail, not the boundary between planning and execution.

#### 4.1 Plan Depth Guidance

**Lightweight**
- Keep the plan compact
- Usually 2-4 implementation units
- Omit optional sections that add little value

**Standard**
- Use the full core template, omitting optional sections (including High-Level Technical Design) that add no value for this particular work
- Usually 3-6 implementation units
- Include risks, deferred questions, and system-wide impact when relevant

**Deep**
- Use the full core template plus optional analysis sections where warranted
- Usually 4-8 implementation units
- Group units into phases when that improves clarity
- Include alternatives considered, documentation impacts, and deeper risk treatment when warranted

#### 4.1b Optional Deep Plan Extensions

For sufficiently large, risky, or cross-cutting work, add the sections that genuinely help:
- **Alternative Approaches Considered**
- **Success Metrics**
- **Dependencies / Prerequisites**
- **Risk Analysis & Mitigation**
- **Phased Delivery**
- **Documentation Plan**
- **Operational / Rollout Notes**
- **Future Considerations** only when they materially affect current design

Do not add these as boilerplate. Include them only when they improve execution quality or stakeholder alignment.

#### 4.2 Core Plan Template

Omit clearly inapplicable optional sections, especially for Lightweight plans.

```

#### 4.3 Planning Rules

- Prefer path plus class/component/pattern references over brittle line numbers
- Keep implementation units checkable with `- [ ]` syntax for progress tracking
- Do not include implementation code — no imports, exact method signatures, or framework-specific syntax
- Pseudo-code sketches and DSL grammars are allowed in the High-Level Technical Design section and per-unit technical design fields when they communicate design direction. Frame them explicitly as directional guidance, not implementation specification
- Mermaid diagrams are encouraged when they clarify relationships or flows that prose alone would make hard to follow — ERDs for data model changes, sequence diagrams for multi-service interactions, state diagrams for lifecycle transitions, flowcharts for complex branching logic
- Do not include git commands, commit messages, or exact test command recipes
- Do not expand implementation units into micro-step `RED/GREEN/REFACTOR` instructions
- Do not pretend an execution-time question is settled just to make the plan look complete

### Phase 5: Final Review, Write File, and Handoff

#### 5.1 Review Before Writing

Before finalizing, check:
- The plan does not invent product behavior that should have been defined in `ce:brainstorm`
- If there was no origin document, the bounded planning bootstrap established enough product clarity to plan responsibly
- Every major decision is grounded in the origin document or research
- Each implementation unit is concrete, dependency-ordered, and implementation-ready
- If test-first or characterization-first posture was explicit or strongly implied, the relevant units carry it forward with a lightweight `Execution note`
- Test scenarios are specific without becoming test code
- Deferred items are explicit and not hidden as fake certainty
- If a High-Level Technical Design section is included, it uses the right medium for the work, carries the non-prescriptive framing, and does not contain implementation code (no imports, exact signatures, or framework-specific syntax)
- Per-unit technical design fields, if present, are concise and directional rather than copy-paste-ready

If the plan originated from a requirements document, re-read that document and verify:
- The chosen approach still matches the product intent
- Scope boundaries and success criteria are preserved
- Blocking questions were either resolved, explicitly assumed, or sent back to `ce:brainstorm`
- Every section of the origin document is addressed in the plan — scan each section to confirm nothing was silently dropped

#### 5.2 Write Plan File

**REQUIRED: Write the plan file to disk before presenting any options.**

Use the Write tool to save the complete plan to:

```text
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<type>-<descriptive-name>-beta-plan.md
```

Confirm:

```text
Plan written to docs/plans/[filename]
```

**Pipeline mode:** If invoked from an automated workflow such as LFG, SLFG, or any `disable-model-invocation` context, skip interactive questions. Make the needed choices automatically and proceed to writing the plan.

#### 5.3 Post-Generation Options

After writing the plan file, present the options using the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Method). Otherwise present numbered options in chat and wait for the user's reply before proceeding.

**Question:** "Plan ready at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<type>-<name>-beta-plan.md`. What would you like to do next?"

**Options:**
1. **Open plan in editor** - Open the plan file for review
2. **Run `/deepen-plan-beta`** - Stress-test weak sections with targeted research when the plan needs more confidence
3. **Run `document-review` skill** - Improve the plan through structured document review
4. **Share to Proof** - Upload the plan for collaborative review and sharing
5. **Start `/ce:work`** - Begin implementing this plan in the current environment
6. **Start `/ce:work` in another session** - Begin implementing in a separate agent session when the current platform supports it
7. **Create Issue** - Create an issue in the configured tracker

Based on selection:
- **Open plan in editor** → Open `docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md` using the current platform's file-open or editor mechanism (e.g., `open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, or the IDE's file-open API)
- **`/deepen-plan-beta`** → Call `/deepen-plan-beta` with the plan path
- **`document-review` skill** → Load the `document-review` skill with the plan path
- **Share to Proof** → Upload the plan:
  ```bash
  CONTENT=$(cat docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md)
  TITLE="Plan: <plan title from frontmatter>"
  RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST https://www.proofeditor.ai/share/markdown \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(jq -n --arg title "$TITLE" --arg markdown "$CONTENT" --arg by "ai:compound" '{title: $title, markdown: $markdown, by: $by}')")
  PROOF_URL=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.tokenUrl')
  ```
  Display `View & collaborate in Proof: <PROOF_URL>` if successful, then return to the options
- **`/ce:work`** → Call `/ce:work` with the plan path
- **`/ce:work` in another session** → If the current platform supports launching a separate agent session, start `/ce:work` with the plan path there. Otherwise, explain the limitation briefly and offer to run `/ce:work` in the current session instead.
- **Create Issue** → Follow the Issue Creation section below
- **Other** → Accept free text for revisions and loop back to options

If running with ultrathink enabled, or the platform's reasoning/effort level is set to max or extra-high, automatically run `/deepen-plan-beta` only when the plan is `Standard` or `Deep`, high-risk, or still shows meaningful confidence gaps in decisions, sequencing, system-wide impact, risks, or verification.

## Issue Creation

When the user selects "Create Issue", detect their project tracker from `AGENTS.md` or, if needed for compatibility, `CLAUDE.md`:

1. Look for `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`
2. If GitHub:

   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "<type>: <title>" --body-file <plan_path>
   ```

3. If Linear:

   ```bash
   linear issue create --title "<title>" --description "$(cat <plan_path>)"
   ```

4. If no tracker is configured:
   - Ask which tracker they use using the platform's blocking question tool when available (see Interaction Method)
   - Suggest adding the tracker to `AGENTS.md` for future runs

After issue creation:
- Display the issue URL
- Ask whether to proceed to `/ce:work`

NEVER CODE! Research, decide, and write the plan.
