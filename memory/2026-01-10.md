- Telegram Side Chat: David shared several AI images of Steve (anthro fox in blue hoodie). Clean headshot on gray background chosen as Telegram profile photo. Saved locally as `assets/steve-avatar-telegram-2026-01-10.jpg`.
- Follow-up: David asked to turn the other images into reaction images/stickers; exported 512×512 stickers in `assets/stickers/` and sent them in chat.
- Etsy: David asked for shop “admirers” counts. Pulled via Etsy API:
  - Patterns4Printing (P4P): 14
  - CustomCanvasCurators (CCC): 146
- Etsy alerts: Updated cron job `etsy-sales-monitor` to poll Etsy API shop stats and alert in Telegram group when `transaction_sold_count` increases (every 10 minutes).
- Process correction from David: Never write people notes to `people/*.md`; always store people memory in ppl.gift. Journal has two destinations: media archive (Steve_Journal) + ppl.gift journal endpoints for entries.
- Identity correction from David: Steve is a fox (not a wolf); updated `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md`.
- Sticker pack: David shared a sticker sheet image; extracted 9 transparent 512×512 stickers to `assets/stickers/pack-2026-01-10/` and sent in Telegram.
