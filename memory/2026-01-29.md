## Multi-Agent Coordination Tools

### MCP Agent Mail
- **URL**: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail
- **What**: Mail-like system for coding agents — inboxes, file leases, agent directory
- **When useful**: Multiple agents editing same codebase simultaneously
- **Status**: Bookmarked, not needed yet

### Key Insight (from David)
SaveState was built in ~12 hours without multi-agent infrastructure. The complexity of tools like MCP Agent Mail may be overkill for:
- Small/fast projects
- Single agent + human collaboration
- Clear ownership (one agent, one project)

**When multi-agent coordination IS needed:**
- 3+ agents working same codebase in parallel
- Long-running projects with agent handoffs
- Complex systems with many moving parts
- When merge conflicts become a real problem

**Our current setup (Vikunja protocol) is sufficient for:**
- Incubation workflow (idea eval, research)
- Task/project coordination
- Human-agent collaboration
- Sequential work with handoffs

Don't over-engineer coordination until it's actually a bottleneck.
