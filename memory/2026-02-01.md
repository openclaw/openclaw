- **Configuration Change:** David requested to change the default Telegram group policy. I updated the gateway configuration so that I will respond to all messages in groups, not just mentions (`requireMention: false`).
- **Heartbeat Task Removed:** Per David's request, I've stopped working on the Agent Console rebuild as my default heartbeat task. The `HEARTBEAT.md` file is now set to `HEARTBEAT_OK`, and I will focus on proactive checks (email, calendar, etc.) during heartbeats.
- **New Agents Created:** The 12:00 sync included the creation of two new agent definitions in the workspace: `savestate-sally` and `undercover-andy`.
- **Model Identity:** Clarified for David that my primary model is `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` and explained how he would be notified if a fallback model is used (either by me announcing it or via the `session_status` tool).
- **Agent Workspace Restructuring:** Per David's clarification, I moved the newly created agents (`meshguard-matt`, `savestate-sally`, `undercover-andy`) from the `clawd/agents/` collection to their own top-level directories (`/Users/steve/meshguard-matt`, etc.) to reflect their status as independent entities. I also updated the gateway configuration (`openclaw.json`) to point to these new locations.
- **MeshGuard Matt Onboarded:** David provided a Telegram token for MeshGuard Matt. I updated the gateway configuration to add his account and binding, allowing him to respond to Telegram chats.
- **Backup Protocol Established:** After David reminded me of the importance of backing up configuration changes, I established a new standard operating procedure: before editing `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, I will now automatically create a timestamped backup of the file in `~/.openclaw/backups/`. I created the first backup of the file containing Matt's configuration.
- **Gateway Restarts:** David prefers to restart the gateway manually after configuration changes. I will not attempt to restart the gateway automatically in the future unless explicitly granted permission via the `commands.restart` config setting.
