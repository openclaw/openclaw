## Agent Console v2 — MAJOR PROGRESS 🎉

### What We Built Today
- ✅ **Prisma schema** — Projects, Tasks, Comments, TaskSessions, Agents (bespoke DB)
- ✅ **Projects CRUD** — Full create/edit/delete with emoji picker, color palette, status
- ✅ **Tasks Kanban** — 4 columns (Inbox → Assigned → Running → Done)
- ✅ **Task Detail Panel** — Status/priority/agent dropdowns, comments, token/cost tracking
- ✅ **Agent Registry** — 8 agents seeded (Steve, Builder, Scout, Canvas, etc.)
- ✅ **Sample Data** — MeshGuard project + sample tasks in various states

### Still To Build
- [ ] Wire "Start Agent" button to actually spawn sessions
- [ ] Task ↔ Session linking (session links back to task, cost rolls up)
- [ ] Intervention controls (pause/resume/kill from UI)
- [ ] Dashboard with real bespoke data (not gateway-only)
- [ ] Mobile bottom nav refinement

## Agent Console v2 Pivot 🔄

**Major realization today:** I was building Agent Console wrong.

### What I was doing (wrong):
- Building a Vikunja viewer/proxy
- Displaying external data
- Mock data fallbacks
- Just an "observability dashboard"

### What it actually is (correct):
- **MY command center** for orchestrating sub-agents
- **Bespoke system** that REPLACES Vikunja entirely
- Own database for Projects, Tasks, Comments
- Operational control, not just observability
- I spawn agents FOR tasks, sessions link back, cost rolls up

### David's feedback that triggered this:
> "We are NOT using vikunja. You are building a bespoke system that replaces that tool!"
> "This is the real agent ops management, orchestration project and task system you want to run Steve. Think what makes sense for you."

### v2 Spec Created
- File: `/Users/steve/clawd/memory/agent-console-spec-v2.md`
- Bear: "Agent Console — Spec v2"

### Key Data Model
- **Projects** — DBH Ventures incubation projects
- **Tasks** — Work items with status, priority, assigned agent
- **Comments** — On tasks for context/handoffs
- **TaskSessions** — Links sessions to tasks for cost tracking
- **Agents** — Registry of sub-agents

### Rebuild Sprint Started
1. Fix CSS (Tailwind v4 @layer architecture)
2. Prisma schema for our own models
3. Projects CRUD
4. Tasks CRUD with Kanban
5. Agent spawning from tasks
6. Intervention controls

### Lessons Learned
- Don't assume external integrations — ask what we're actually building
- "Your dashboard" means MY operational tool, not a generic viewer
- The spec I created was correct, I just didn't follow it properly

## Earlier Today

- Verified Agent Console dashboard pulling real gateway data
- Fixed Prisma postinstall for Vercel builds
- Mobile nav fixed (safe area padding)
- Builder/Canvas sub-agents did incremental fixes (now obsolete with v2 pivot)
