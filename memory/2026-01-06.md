# 2026-01-06 (Tuesday)

## Notes
- Session started ~3am (quiet hours)

## Upcoming
- Kate flies back to Regent Thursday night (Jan 9) out of PVD
- Logan Hodges birthday: Jan 12 (6 days)
- Alana Hodges birthday: Jan 18 (12 days)

## Cron Jobs Audit
- Verified all cron jobs
- Removed duplicate `upstream-sync` job (sync-skills already handles it)
- Active: crypto-alert-check, daily-verse, sync-skills, kate-airport-thu

## Rules Learned
- Don't auto-publish skills to ClawdHub
- Check existing cron jobs before creating new ones

## CRM Setup (clarified)
- **ppl.gift** = Personal life (family, friends, personal contacts)
- **Twenty** = Work / One Point (business contacts, clients)
