# AG-UI channel

![Banner](./ag-ui.png)

A bundled [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) channel that exposes
your gateway as an [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com) protocol endpoint over HTTP +
Server-Sent Events. Any AG-UI client — `@ag-ui/client`, a custom web UI, or a
plain `curl` — can POST a conversation and stream the agent's reply back as
AG-UI events (text, tool calls, reasoning, and generative UI).

It ships **inside** OpenClaw, so there's nothing to build — you just enable it.

---

## Quick start

Three steps to a live endpoint:

**1. Enable the channel.** Add it to your gateway config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "ag-ui": { "enabled": true, "name": "AG-UI" }
  }
}
```

**2. (Re)start the gateway:**

```bash
openclaw gateway run
```

On startup you'll see `ag-ui` in the loaded channel list and
`AG-UI channel active (HTTP endpoint ready)` in the logs. Two routes are now
served (replace `http://localhost:8000` with your gateway's host/port):

| Route                     | Auth                                                             | Use it for                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/ag-ui/operator` | Gateway token (`Authorization: Bearer <OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN>`) | Trusted, server-side integrations where the token stays on a server you control (behind your own auth). |
| `POST /v1/ag-ui`          | Device pairing (per-client token)                                | Untrusted / external AG-UI clients that pair once and get their own token.                              |

**3. Say hi.** With the operator route and your gateway token:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui/operator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in 3 words"}]}'
```

You'll get an SSE stream: `RUN_STARTED` → `TEXT_MESSAGE_*` → `RUN_FINISHED`.

> The channel uses whatever agent + model your gateway is already configured
> with — it doesn't pick a model itself. Make sure a provider/model is set up
> (`openclaw models …`) before your first turn.

---

## Installation

The channel is **bundled with OpenClaw** — if you're running the gateway, it's
already present and just needs [enabling](#quick-start). Nothing to install or
build.

Running an OpenClaw build that doesn't bundle it? Install the published package
and enable it the same way:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/ag-ui
```

---

## How it works

The channel registers with the gateway and serves the two HTTP routes above.
When an AG-UI client POSTs a `RunAgentInput` payload, the channel:

1. **Authenticates** the request — a gateway token on `/v1/ag-ui/operator`, or a
   paired device token on `/v1/ag-ui` (see [Authentication](#authentication)).
2. **Parses** the AG-UI messages into a prompt, sending only the _delta_ since
   the last assistant turn (a stable per-conversation session supplies the rest
   of the history).
3. **Routes** to the target agent via the gateway's standard routing.
4. **Runs** the turn through the embedded agent (`runEmbeddedAgent`) against a
   stable per-conversation session, so conversation history, compaction, and
   context management come for free.
5. **Streams** the response back as AG-UI SSE events — assistant text, tool
   calls, reasoning summaries, and A2UI generative-UI surfaces.

```

```

## Authentication

The channel offers two auth modes on two routes. Pick based on how much you
trust the client.

### Operator token — `/v1/ag-ui/operator`

For **trusted, server-side** integrations. The caller presents the gateway
token, and the route is scoped to `operator.write` (least privilege — it can run
agent turns but cannot reach admin, pairing, or secret surfaces). No pairing
step.

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui/operator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Use this when the token stays on a server you control — e.g. a server-side
runtime or backend proxy that has already authenticated the end user. **Never
ship the gateway token to a browser.**

### Device pairing — `/v1/ag-ui`

For **untrusted / external** clients. Each client pairs once and receives its own
device token, so you get per-device access control without exposing the gateway
token.

```

```

**Step 1 — client initiates pairing** (POST with no `Authorization` header):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

Response (`403`):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "pairing_pending",
    "message": "Device pending approval",
    "pairing": {
      "pairingCode": "ABCD1234",
      "token": "MmRlOTA0ODIt...b71d",
      "instructions": "Save this token for use as a Bearer token and ask the owner to approve: openclaw pairing approve ag-ui ABCD1234"
    }
  }
}
```

The client saves the `token`.

**Step 2 — owner approves** (the client shares the `pairingCode` out of band):

```bash
openclaw pairing list ag-ui          # see pending requests
openclaw pairing approve ag-ui ABCD1234
```

**Step 3 — client uses its device token** on every request:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer MmRlOTA0ODIt...b71d" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

### Auth errors

| Status | Type              | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 401    | `unauthorized`    | Invalid device or gateway token                                                             |
| 403    | `pairing_pending` | (`/v1/ag-ui`) No auth header (initiates pairing) or valid token but device not yet approved |

> **Note on the gateway token.** The device route `/v1/ag-ui` does **not** accept
> the raw gateway/master token — it requires pairing. If you have a trusted
> server-side integration and want token auth, use `/v1/ag-ui/operator` instead,
> which accepts the gateway token with a least-privilege operator scope.

---

## Using an AG-UI client

Any AG-UI client works. With `@ag-ui/client` against the pairing route:

```typescript
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const agent = new HttpAgent({
  url: "http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AG_UI_DEVICE_TOKEN}` },
});

const stream = agent.run({
  threadId: "thread-1",
  runId: "run-1",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello from AG-UI" }],
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  console.log(event.type, event);
}
```

For the operator route, point the client at `/v1/ag-ui/operator` and pass the
gateway token instead — from server-side code only.

---

## Request format

POST a JSON body matching the AG-UI `RunAgentInput` schema:

### Tool call events

Tool events are emitted when the agent invokes a tool during its run, mapped
from OpenClaw's `before_tool_call` / `tool_result_persist` lifecycle hooks.

**When do they appear?**

- The agent has tools available (server-side tools, or client tools passed via
  the request's `tools` field), **and**
- the model decides to call one based on the conversation.

**Client tools vs server tools:**

- **Client tools** (from the request `tools`): the stream emits `TOOL_CALL_START`
  → `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` → `TOOL_CALL_END`, then the run finishes. The client
  executes the tool locally and starts a new run with the result as a `tool`
  message.
- **Server tools** (registered on the agent): the stream emits `TOOL_CALL_START`
  → `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` → `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` → `TOOL_CALL_END`, and the agent keeps
  going.

---

## Agent routing

Messages route via OpenClaw's standard routing (to the `main` agent by default).
Target a specific agent with the `X-OpenClaw-Agent-Id` header:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui/operator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-OpenClaw-Agent-Id: my-agent" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

---

## Session isolation

By default, sessions are keyed by `route.sessionKey` plus a `:thread:<threadId>`
suffix, so each thread gets its own conversation history within the caller. For
multi-user apps where each user needs isolated history within one shared client,
add the `X-OpenClaw-Session-Key` header to layer a `:user:<value>` scope on top:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/ag-ui/operator \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-OpenClaw-Session-Key: user@example.com" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Useful when:

- Multiple authenticated users share one AG-UI client (e.g. a web app with auth).
- You want to key sessions by user identity _in addition to_ thread ID.
- The AG-UI client manages `threadId` internally.

### How the final session key is composed

The header **scopes** the route-derived key; it never replaces it:

```
<route.sessionKey>[:user:<header>][:thread:<threadId>]
```

With no header the key is `<route.sessionKey>:thread:<threadId>`. With the header
`alice@example.com` and `threadId: "t-1"` it becomes
`<route.sessionKey>:user:alice@example.com:thread:t-1`. The header can only
subdivide an existing route scope — it cannot escape it.

### Trust model — treat this header like `X-Forwarded-For`

`X-OpenClaw-Session-Key` is a **trusted-proxy-only** concern, in the same family
as `X-Forwarded-For`. It should be set by a reverse proxy or auth middleware that
has already authenticated the user — not by end clients.

Deployments reachable by untrusted clients **must strip or overwrite this header
at the ingress edge** before forwarding to the gateway. If an end client can set
it freely, they can impersonate any other user's session scope for that device.

### Validation

The header value must match these rules; invalid values return
`HTTP 400 invalid_request_error` and the agent is not dispatched:

- 1–256 characters after trimming.
- Characters restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9._@:-]` (covers emails, UUIDs, and
  colon-separated identifiers).
- No path-traversal: rejects `..`, slashes (`/`, `\`), and null bytes.

## Error responses

Non-streaming errors return JSON:

| Status | Type                    | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `invalid_request_error` | Invalid request (missing messages, bad JSON, bad session-key header)                        |
| 401    | `unauthorized`          | Invalid device or gateway token                                                             |
| 403    | `pairing_pending`       | (`/v1/ag-ui`) No auth header (initiates pairing) or valid token but device not yet approved |
| 405    | —                       | Method not allowed (only POST accepted)                                                     |

Errors that happen mid-stream emit a `RUN_ERROR` event and close the connection.

---

## Development

This channel lives in the OpenClaw monorepo under `extensions/ag-ui`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw
cd openclaw
pnpm install
pnpm test extensions/ag-ui        # run the channel's tests
```

Layout:

- `index.ts` — the bundled channel entry (`defineBundledChannelEntry`): registers
  the channel, the `/v1/ag-ui` + `/v1/ag-ui/operator` routes, tool-lifecycle
  hooks, and the CLI.
- `src/http-handler.ts` — request handling, auth, AG-UI ⇄ OpenClaw translation,
  and the SSE event stream.
- `src/channel.ts` — the channel plugin (metadata, pairing, gateway lifecycle).
- `src/hooks.ts` — maps OpenClaw tool-lifecycle hooks to AG-UI `TOOL_CALL_*`
  events.
- `src/a2ui.ts` — detects A2UI operations in tool results and emits them as
  `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` surfaces.
- `setup-entry.ts` / `src/config-schema.ts` — the bundled-channel setup surface
  and config schema used by discovery/activation.
