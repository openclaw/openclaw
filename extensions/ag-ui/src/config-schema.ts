// AG-UI channel config surface.
//
// The AG-UI channel is an inbound HTTP/SSE endpoint with no external
// credentials, so enabling it (`channels.ag-ui.enabled: true`) is all that is
// required to activate its `/v1/ag-ui` routes. This schema also documents the
// streaming/surfacing toggles the channel honors.
//
// Consumed at build time by scripts/generate-bundled-channel-config-metadata.ts
// (the export name must end in "ChannelConfigSchema" and expose a built
// `{ schema, uiHints }` surface) so ag-ui is registered in the bundled-channel
// config metadata. Without this, the gateway does not recognize
// `channels.ag-ui` as a known channel and never activates the plugin.
