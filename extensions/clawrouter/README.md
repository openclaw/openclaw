# ClawRouter

Managed multi-provider model routing and quota reporting for OpenClaw.

When `models.providers.clawrouter` is configured, the bundled plugin adds
**ClawRouter** to the Control UI sidebar. Its read-only pool dashboard shows
subscription quota windows, account and plan details, model eligibility,
extra usage, and traffic behind the configured key. **Refresh** fetches a new
snapshot. The ClawRouter policy must opt in to pool status visibility.

The plugin owns both the native browser bundle and the `clawrouter.pool.get`
Gateway method (`operator.read`). Credentials remain on the Gateway. Older
ClawRouter deployments, hidden policies, and unavailable or rejected credentials
show actionable status messages. The existing usage snapshot is unchanged.

See the [ClawRouter provider docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/clawrouter#pool-dashboard).
