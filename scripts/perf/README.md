# Team-shaped synthetic state

Use one fixture for local and sandbox performance repros:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/perf/team-shape-fixture.ts \
  --state-dir /tmp/openclaw-team-shape --launch
```

The destination **must not exist**. The generator refuses existing directories and
symlinks instead of overwriting state. Everything it creates lives below that
path: SQLite stores, config, HOME, temporary files, logs, Git repositories and
worktrees. No operator data or credentials are copied. The launcher runs the
repository's `pnpm openclaw gateway run` with an isolated environment, binds only
loopback (default port 40967), and forwards shutdown signals through the existing
managed-process helper. It does not install or restart a service. Ctrl-C stops
the launcher and Gateway; the fixture remains available for inspection.
The profile `team-shape-<port>` and its explicit native service names keep dev
build ownership checks separate from the host's default Gateway.

Use a checkout with dependencies installed. The normal dev launcher may build
missing/stale runtime artifacts; on hosts that prohibit builds, prepare the
checkout on the authorized benchmark host. Generation itself does not need a
Gateway build. Never point another running Gateway at a directory being seeded.
Package-manager caches are isolated too: Corepack or pnpm version shims may
download the pinned package manager into the fresh HOME. For offline launch,
put a directly installed copy of the repository's pinned pnpm version on PATH.
The launcher intentionally does not reuse an operator's package-manager cache.

## Shape and repeatability

Defaults are 5,000 sessions in the `main` agent, 6,000 retained subagent runs,
200 pending approval recovery records, 100 disabled cron jobs, and 12 registered
projects with committed synthetic Git repositories and real worktrees.

Sessions have 24 synthetic human identities, assigned owners, 1–5 participants,
a 70/10/10/10 split of shared/read-only/suggest/draft visibility, pinned rows and
20% archived rows. Activity timestamps span 30 days. Transcript weights use an
80/17/3 percent short/medium/long distribution, with weights 1/16/128. The seed
controls both size assignment and synthetic payload content. Retained runs mix
successful terminal, failed terminal, pending announcement, and interrupted
with completed cleanup. The 60/15/15/10 slot mix applies before older pending
generations are settled; only latest generations keep pending announcements.
Actual state counts are included in the summary. Twenty percent of sessions are
roots, with children distributed across them and repeated runs in time order. Supporting state uses the existing
storage owners and schema; the generator changes no product schema.

```sh
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/perf/team-shape-fixture.ts \
  --state-dir /tmp/openclaw-team-shape-large \
  --sessions 5000 --runs 6000 --approvals 200 --cron 100 --projects 12 \
  --seed 967 --now 1791892800000 --transcript-mib 7000
```

`--transcript-mib` is total **logical message text**, not physical database size.
The default is 64 MiB. Deterministic high-entropy text prevents compression from
turning gigabytes of repeated padding into a tiny database. The persisted size
also includes transcript projections and SQLite overhead: use the reported
`agentDatabaseBytes`, not the requested MiB, when comparing fixtures. Memory is
bounded by transcript batches rather than total payload size. For tens of GB,
raise this option and verify free disk space first.

The default seed is 967 and the default reference time is 2026-10-13 12:00 UTC.
Pass the same `--seed` and `--now` to reproduce logical data. Set `--now` near the
measurement date when testing retention; a frozen old epoch intentionally makes
rows old. Filesystem paths, database admission metadata and project registration
timestamps are host-dependent, so SQLite files are not byte-identical exports.
`team-shape-summary.json` records inputs, counts, actual bytes, Node version and
elapsed generation time. Generation failure leaves the partial directory for
diagnosis; remove only that task-owned fixture before retrying.

Pending approvals represent a **startup recovery backlog**, not live authority.
The real Gateway cancels prior-epoch requests on boot. Pending announcements also
participate in normal recovery; their next attempt is delayed one day from the
reference time. Generate a fresh fixture for each startup comparison. Cron jobs,
heartbeats, channels, plugins, browser automation and network discovery are
disabled so this workload does not call models or external integrations.

## Measure the real list endpoint

With the fixture Gateway running, use a second terminal:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/perf/team-shape-measure.ts \
  --port 40967 --samples 100 --limit 100
```

This uses the real `sessions.list` WebSocket RPC, compact rows and all archived
states. It reports the first call separately, then mean/p50/p95/p99 after five
warmups, plus response size. It uses one operator connection: production's
multiple viewers, mutations, background work and page-cache pressure can be more
expensive. Matching database size alone does not prove production equivalence.
Compare a small fixture and the default fixture on the same checkout and host;
record counts, database bytes, exact revision and request shape with the timings.

## Measure transcript broadcast fanout

With runtime artifacts built on the authorized benchmark host, seed a fixture
without `--launch`, then run:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/tsx.mjs scripts/perf/transcript-broadcast-measure.ts \
  --state-dir /path/to/team-shape --clients 60 --runs 20 --rounds 5 --chunks 500
```

The driver starts its own loopback Gateway and a credential-free SSE model
fixture on ports 41033 and 41034. It creates one shared parent and 20 shared child
sessions through `sessions.create`, then resets their histories through
`sessions.reset` before each comparison. The full seeded inventory remains;
these small sessions avoid large-history compaction and retained-run announcement
work obscuring broadcast costs. Standard memory search is disabled and both main
and child run concurrency match `--runs`. Every client subscribes to session-list
events and messages for the same 20 children. Actual `agent` and `agent.wait` RPCs
exercise the full turn and transcript publication paths;
each synthetic model answer streams deltas paced 10 ms apart (100 by default;
the example uses 500 to sustain overlap). Each warmup/measured cohort holds its
primary model responses until all requested, uniquely marked turns arrive, with
a 45-second admission timeout, then streams their answers together. Parent
announcements and utility requests receive one short acknowledgement and are
counted separately. A fixed 10-second post-readiness delay allows retained-run
startup recovery to settle before setup. One concurrent round
warms the Gateway before five measured rounds. `--port`, `--mock-port`,
`--chunks`, `--clients`, `--runs`, and `--rounds` adjust the workload.
Warmup and each measured round drain until no model streams remain and all
subscriber events have been quiet for one second, with a 15-second timeout.

Results under the fixture's `broadcast-measure-*` directory include Gateway
logs, event counts, peak concurrent model streams, and CPU snapshots from the
Gateway's private benchmark IPC preload. Main-thread CPU excludes the driver
and model fixture. Port conflicts reject before RPCs; readiness requires the
owned Gateway's bind-success log and live IPC. Lost clients, event-sequence gaps,
incomplete per-client transcript/list fanout, or an incorrect primary request or
overlap count fail the measurement. `mainThreadMsPerSessionEvent` divides by
the validated `session.message` plus `sessions.changed` copies per client;
other event counts remain in the report. It includes all Gateway work during the
round, including the drain interval, so it does not isolate broadcast CPU and
CPU per second includes that quiet interval. Compare the same event counts and
concurrency on both revisions, and report the actual database size. For a roughly 5 GiB fixture, seed with
`--transcript-mib 1500` rather than the 64 MiB logical-text default. The driver
stops its Gateway and model fixture on completion or interruption and retains
synthetic state for inspection. Never target a running Gateway's state.

To start an existing fixture without regenerating it, set `HOME` and
`OPENCLAW_HOME` to `<state-dir>/home`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` to `<state-dir>`,
`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` to `<state-dir>/openclaw.json`, and `TMPDIR` to
`<state-dir>/tmp`, then use `pnpm openclaw gateway run --bind loopback --port 40967`
in a credential-free environment. Also set `OPENCLAW_PROFILE=team-shape-40967`
and the native selector: `OPENCLAW_SYSTEMD_UNIT=openclaw-gateway-team-shape-40967`
on Linux, `OPENCLAW_LAUNCHD_LABEL=ai.openclaw.team-shape-40967` on macOS, or
`OPENCLAW_WINDOWS_TASK_NAME=OpenClaw Gateway (team-shape-40967)` on Windows.
Use the corresponding suffix when changing ports. The generated config uses no authentication
and is only suitable for isolated loopback repros.

## Sandbox measurements

Follow the current host policy. On Team, use only a task-owned
`/srv/perf-sandbox/<lane>/` checkout and fixture, with HOME, OPENCLAW_HOME and TMPDIR
inside that directory. Wrap every remote command with:

```sh
systemd-run --scope --quiet -p AllowedCPUs=64-127 -p MemoryMax=64G \
  nice -n 10 ionice -c3 <command>
```

Use loopback ports at least 40000. Never read/copy production databases or touch
production services. Stop your own Gateway, then remove your sandbox after
recording results. Local validation is limited to changed-file format/lint and
focused tests; PR CI owns broad gates.
