# Agent backup gitignore
# Only commit safe, non-sensitive markdown/yaml files.

# Exclude session transcripts (can be large and contain private conversation content)
*.jsonl
*.json

# Exclude binary / lock files
*.bin
*.lock
node_modules/

# Exclude environment and credential files
*.env
.env*
credentials/
sessions/

# --- Everything below is INCLUDED (safe to commit) ---
# The following patterns are NOT listed here because git ignores don't have
# an "include-only" mode at the file-extension level without negation.
# Instead we explicitly allow *.md and *.yaml via negation:
!*.md
!*.yaml
!*.yml
!.gitkeep
