# Credential & Config Investigation Protocol

When investigating authentication or configuration issues, check ALL sources before proposing fixes.

## Required Checks (Bug Comorbidity)

For GOG/Google auth issues, check ALL of these:
- `~/.config/gogcli/config.json` - backend setting
- `~/.config/gogcli/keyring/` - token files
- `~/.config/gogcli/keyring-password` - password file
- `~/.clawdbot/credentials/liam.env` - GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD env var
- `~/.profile` - exported environment variables

For any credential issue:
1. Identify ALL places the credential could be stored
2. Check for mismatches between locations
3. Verify the runtime environment matches config files

## Common Comorbidity Pattern

Password/token mismatch across locations:
- Keyring encrypted with password A
- Environment variable set to password B
- Fix: Ensure all locations use the same value

## APEX Compliance

Before proposing a fix:
1. Map the full credential flow
2. Check ALL config sources
3. Identify the actual mismatch
4. Propose the minimal fix (often just updating one value)

Do NOT propose re-authentication if the issue is a simple config mismatch.
