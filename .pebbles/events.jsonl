Calls gateway 'agent' method internally. Returns { runId }.\n- waitForRun(params): Block until a run completes. Calls gateway 'agent.wait' internally. Returns { status, error? }.\n- deleteSession(params): Delete an ephemeral session. Calls gateway 'sessions.delete' internally. Returns void.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Add subagent types and property to src/plugins/runtime/types.ts\n2. Wire implementation in wherever PluginRuntime is constructed (look at src/gateway/server-plugins.ts or similar). Use handleGatewayRequest with a synthetic operator client for internal dispatch — NOT callGateway which opens a WebSocket to itself.\n3. Export types from plugin-sdk/index.ts so external plugins can reference them.\n4. Add tests.\n\nBranch: josh/context-engine (already checked out)\nDo NOT touch any other branch.","priority":"1","title":"Add scoped subagent methods to PluginRuntime","type":"task"}}
