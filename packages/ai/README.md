# `@openclaw/ai`

Reusable model API contracts, provider adapters, and streaming primitives from
OpenClaw. The package supports isolated runtime instances; importing it does not
register providers globally.

```ts
import { createLlmRuntime } from "@openclaw/ai";
import { registerBuiltInApiProviders } from "@openclaw/ai/providers";

const runtime = createLlmRuntime();
registerBuiltInApiProviders(runtime.registry);
```

Provider-neutral contracts, validation, diagnostics, and event streams are
available from the package root and focused subpaths such as
`@openclaw/ai/event-stream`, `@openclaw/ai/transports`, and
`@openclaw/ai/validation`. No second OpenClaw runtime package is required.

Provider ids, credentials, model catalogs, retries, and failover remain
application concerns. OpenClaw supplies those policies around this package.
Host policy (request fetch guarding, secret redaction, strict-tool defaults,
provider plugin hooks, diagnostics logging, and typed transport-event
observation) can be injected with `configureAiTransportHost`; the defaults are
inert. `buildModelFetchWithBlockingDispatchGuard` owns the fail-closed
`beforeFetchDispatch` callback invoked for every physical fetch hop after SSRF
and DNS preflight but before network dispatch; throwing prevents that hop, and
a host that cannot install the named guard fails closed.
`buildModelFetchWithDispatchAttestation` is the separate optional port for
non-blocking per-hop observation. Both named ports require a structured
`AiModelFetchResult` with `dispatch_attested` provenance; legacy
`buildModelFetch` remains callable-only and cannot attest dispatch.
Within those ports, `observeFetchDispatch` runs once per physical hop, including
redirects. `onFetchDispatch` remains isolated observational accounting, runs
once per provider-request fetch invocation, and cannot change provider
behavior. A transport attempt is one dispatched provider request, distinct from
its physical fetch hops. Connection setup and prewarm are separate facts.
Transport fallback stages a concrete target until a matching attempt or
zero-submission phase consumes it. Server-side provider fallback records an
in-stream serving-model transition without rewriting the requested
provider/model/API identity. Failed or aborted calls that end before the
dispatch boundary use an explicit zero-submission fact instead of an invented
attempt. Exact zero requires a structured `AiModelFetchResult` with
`dispatch_attested` provenance; a legacy bare fetch without callback evidence
remains unavailable. Directly injected provider SDK clients remain supported,
but their endpoint and transport authority is partial/unverified because
OpenClaw cannot attest the client's physical hops. When a physical attempt is
known but terminal provider fallback metadata is unavailable, scoped coverage
lowers only the derived provider-fallback total and serving-model identity;
endpoint-authority or terminal-completion ambiguity instead marks transport
semantics unverified. Emitted event counts and dispatch-attested attempt counts
remain exact; attempt totals behind directly injected clients remain
lower-bound or unavailable.
Anthropic server fallback is enabled only when the host installs the named
blocking dispatch guard. Without that guard, the requested model call remains
usable and the fallback beta and payload field are omitted; endpoint authority
still follows the host's independent dispatch-attestation capability.

The explicit `@openclaw/ai/internal/anthropic`, `openai`, `retry-after`,
`runtime`, and `shared` subpaths exist for the OpenClaw application itself.
They carry no semver guarantee and can change or disappear in any release; do
not depend on them outside OpenClaw.
