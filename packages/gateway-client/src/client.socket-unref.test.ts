/**
 * Regression test for issue #88230.
 *
 * The CLI path `openclaw message send` tears the gateway client down after
 * delivery and relies on a natural process exit. If the WebSocket's underlying
 * `_socket` file descriptor stays ref'd in the Node event loop, the process
 * hangs indefinitely even though the close handshake has been initiated.
 *
 * Two teardown contracts share `beginStop()` and must both end with the socket
 * unref'd, but with different *timing*:
 *
 *  - `stop()` is fire-and-forget (the CLI `message send` path). Nobody awaits
 *    it, so it must unref the socket immediately after `ws.close()`.
 *  - `stopAndWait()` is awaited (e.g. `openclaw message send --json`, which
 *    writes its JSON result only after teardown settles). It must keep the
 *    socket ref'd until its promise settles, then unref — otherwise unrefing
 *    the last handle up-front lets the process exit mid-await, before the
 *    result is written (ClawSweeper review P1, confidence 0.86).
 *
 * These tests pin both behaviors.
