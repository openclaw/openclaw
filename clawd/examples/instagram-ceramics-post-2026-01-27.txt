CAPTION:
Morning coffee in the jungle 🌱

Two-tone mug — black meets brown, held by the hand that made it. Surrounded by leaves that are growing while we sleep.

There's something about handmade ceramics in a plant-filled space that just works. The materials know each other.

Handbuilt with intention. Glazed with patience. Used daily.
