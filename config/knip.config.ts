/**
 * Single Knip config, zero `ignore` patterns.
 *
 *   knip --config config/knip.config.ts --production   → production dead-code scan
 *   knip --config config/knip.config.ts                → full-tree export audit
 *
 * Extensions are covered by the built-in `openclaw` plugin (reads the `openclaw`
 * package.json manifest + resolves public surfaces by convention). Test-support
 * and scripts are scoped out of the production graph with production-only project
 * negations (`!…!`) instead of `ignore`, so the full-tree run still audits them.
 *
 * A negation drops a file from the production graph, so it also stops counting
 * as a consumer. Keep them anchored to real test-support names: a repo-wide
 * `live-` prefix or `-test-` infix glob swallows production owners too, and
 * their exports then read as unused.
