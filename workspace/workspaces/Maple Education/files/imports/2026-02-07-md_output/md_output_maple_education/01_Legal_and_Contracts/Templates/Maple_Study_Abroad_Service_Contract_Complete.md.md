## 5. Refund Policy  
## 五、退费规则

5.1 **General Principle 一般原则**  

Service Fee is charged for consulting and service efforts rather than the final outcome. Refunds (if any) are based on the actual progress of services rendered and the stage at which the Agreement is terminated.  
服务费系就乙方提供的咨询与服务过程收取，并非就最终结果收费。任何退费（如有）均以乙方实际已完成服务的阶段及本合同终止时的进度为基础进行综合评估。

5.2 **Circumstances where Service Fee is Generally Non‑Refundable**  
5.2 **下列情形下服务费原则上不予退还**

Unless otherwise mandated by law, Service Fee already paid shall generally not be refunded in the following circumstances:  
除法律另有强制规定外，已支付的服务费在下列情形下原则上不予退还：

- (a) Party A unilaterally terminates this Agreement for personal reasons (e.g. change of plan, unwillingness to study abroad, financial reasons) after Party B has commenced substantive services (planning, document guidance, application creation etc.);  
  (a) 乙方已开始实质性服务（包括但不限于规划、文书指导、申请创建等）后，甲方因个人原因（变更计划、不再出国、资金安排等）单方解除合同；  
- (b) Application is rejected due to Party A’s failure to meet academic, language or other admission criteria, despite Party B having provided reasonable professional advice;  
  (b) 在乙方已提供合理专业建议的前提下，因甲方不符合院校学术、语言或其他录取标准而导致申请被拒；  
- (c) Visa is refused by authorities despite Party A meeting basic disclosed requirements, and there is no evidence of negligence or misconduct by Party B;  
  (c) 在甲方已满足公开条件的前提下，因目的国主管部门签证拒签而导致无法入学，且无证据表明乙方存在重大过失或不当行为；  
- (d) Party A provides false, incomplete or misleading information or documents that materially affect application or visa results;  
  (d) 甲方提供虚假、不完整或具有重大误导性的信息或材料，影响申请或签证结果；  
- (e) Party A fails to cooperate (e.g. not providing documents on time, missing deadlines) after receiving clear written reminders from Party B.  
  (e) 甲方在已收到乙方明确书面提醒的情况下，仍未按时配合提供材料或完成必要操作，致使申请无法按时递交或进度延误。

5.3 **Partial Refund Scenarios 部分退费情形**  

Where Party A terminates services for personal reasons or due to changes in plan before certain key milestones, Party B may, at its discretion and acting reasonably, consider partial refund based on the service stages actually completed. For example:  
如甲方因个人原因或计划变更在达到特定节点前终止服务，乙方可在合理、公允原则下酌情考虑按已完成服务阶段退回部分费用。例如：

- Before application creation starts 在未实际开始网申创建前：可退还已收服务费的一定比例（例如 50–80%）；  
- After partial completion of applications 仅部分申请已创建/递交：可根据完成工作量按比例退还；  
- After all main applications have been submitted 全部主要院校申请已递交：原则上不再退费。  

具体比例由双方在附加的《退费说明》或补充协议中明确约定。  
Exact percentages, if agreed, shall be specified in an attached “Refund Schedule” or addendum.

5.4 **Legal and Regulatory Overrides 法律及监管优先**  

If mandatory consumer protection or education regulations in the relevant jurisdiction provide for stricter refund rights, such mandatory rules shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency with this Clause.  
如相关司法辖区的消费者保护或教育监管规定就退费权利作出更为严格的强制性规定，则在与本条不一致的范围内，以该等强制性规定为准。
