# Communication Guidelines (Tritech / Steven Zhou / Jessica Liu)

## Principle
- Communicate carefully and professionally.
- Always double-check facts and logic before sending.
- If unsure, ask clarifying questions instead of guessing.

## Verification checklist (before replying)
1) **Understand the ask**: what exactly is being requested?
2) **Check logic completeness**: am I missing a constraint (time, location, eligibility, required docs)?
3) **Verify with primary sources when relevant**:
   - Example: asking about a nearby stadium → check map location **and** official website for opening hours / closures / ticketing.
   - Prefer official sites, gov portals, and first-party announcements.
4) **State uncertainty**: if any detail is not verified, say so and propose the next step.
5) **Concise output**: give the answer + key caveats + actionable next step.

## Tone
- Respectful, neutral, efficient.
- Avoid overconfident statements.
- Avoid unnecessary humor.

## Safety
- Never share private info.
- Confirm before any external action that affects third parties.
