MESSAGE TO
SHAREHOLDERS

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, we are pleased to present
the annual report of Tritech Group Limited (“Tritech” or the
“Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for
the financial year ended 31 March 2025 (“FY2025”).

FY2025 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
In FY2025, the Group reported a 9.2% decline in revenue to
$24.8 million as compared to $27.3 million in the previous year
due to concluded smart urban development business projects.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (“MTI”) has slashed
Singapore’s 2025 growth forecast to 0 to 2% from 1 to 3%
amidst the US-China tariff war to account for the significant
deterioration in Singapore’s external demand outlook 1. In
1Q2025, the Singapore economy grew 3.9% year-on-year, which
was a moderation from the 5% increase in the previous quarter.
This was largely driven by the wholesale trade, manufacturing,
and finance and insurance sectors with the manufacturing and
wholesale trade sectors likely being underpinned by front-loading
activities in anticipation of the sweeping US tariff hikes.

Gross profit margin contracted in response to stiff competition
in the Smart Urban Development business, causing the Group’s
gross profit to shrink 13.1% from $8.4 million in financial year
ended 31 March 2024 (“FY2024”) to $7.3 million in FY2025.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, Singapore’s
economy shrank by 0.6%, contrasting against the 0.5%
expansion in the 4Q2024.
With US and China trade talks getting underway, there are signs
of de-escalation in global trade tensions. Nevertheless, MTI
remains cautious and has maintained its full-year forecast with
the view that global economic outlook is shrouded in significant
uncertainty alongside potential downside risks.
MTI does not rule out a possible technical recession and flagged
downside risks of elevated economic uncertainty, re-escalation
in tariff actions, as well as disruptions to the global disinflation
process and recession risks2.
As a result of these events, the Group’s business experienced
intense competition coupled amidst a difficult operating
environment. We have strived to navigate these obstacles to
the best of our ability by increasing efficiency and optimising
our product portfolio to manage our costs. With these efforts
in place, the Group managed to turn our earnings around to be
back in the black.

Segmentally, revenue contribution by the Smart Urban
Development business dipped from $27.3 million in FY2024
to $24.8 million in FY2025, while profit before tax for the year
stood at $1.3 million against $2.1 million in the previous year.
Meanwhile, our Water and Environmental segment recorded a
loss before tax of $228,000.
In view of the above factors, the Group turned around to deliver
profit after tax of $0.03 million in FY2025 against loss after tax
of $2.3 million in FY2024.
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
The Group’s industry in Singapore has been persistently
competitive, adding pressure on the profit margin of the Group’s
successfully tendered projects. As we expect market conditions
to remain challenging, hence we have actively taken steps to
lower our cost to enhance our competitive advantage in order to
boost the Group’s revenue and profit margins. As such, we are
cautiously optimistic about the Group’s performance in the year
ahead, barring any unforeseen circumstances.
With regards to the exercise of put option, the Group had
received a request from Protocol Capital to renegotiate the terms
and conditions of the option, and further extend the options
exercise period by an additional three months till 9 March 2025
to facilitate its funds for this specific placement. As previously
announced, the Group remains in discussions with Protocol
Capital to finalise the execution of the investment agreement and
will provide further updates as and when material developments
concerning this event arise.

FINANCIAL
REVIEW

INCOME STATEMENT
Group revenue declined by 9.2% or $2.5 million from
$27.3 million in FY2024 to $24.8 million in FY2025 as a result
of the completion of specific projects within the Smart Urban
Development business.
In tandem with the decrease in revenue, cost of sales also
contracted by $1.6 million to $17.4 million during the year as
compared to $19.0 million from a year ago. The contraction
was attributed to lower direct wages and subcontractor costs.
In view of the above, the Group reported gross profit of
$7.3 million in FY2025 against gross profit of $8.4 million
in FY2024 with a dip in gross profit margin that was largely
attributed to the Smart Urban Development business.
Meanwhile, other income lowered by $3.7 million to $1.3 million
in the reporting year as compared to $5.0 million in the previous
year as a result of the absence of one-off items recorded
in FY2024, which comprised a fair value gain on contingent
consideration, and the write-back of impairment loss on financial
assets.

For Group expenses, distribution expenses declined by
$0.1 million from $0.4 million in FY2024 to $0.3 million in
FY2025 as driven by lower motor vehicle upkeep costs in the
Smart Urban Development business. Administrative expenses,
which were led by lower consultancy and legal fees related to
corporate and Water and Environmental business activities,
dipped by $1.9 million from $6.3 million in the year before to
$4.4 million in FY2025.
Separately, other expenses saw lower employee-related costs
and utilities expenses, which resulted in a decrease of $0.4
million to $3.1 million in FY2025 as compared to $3.5 million in
FY2024. Finance costs were higher by $0.1 million to $0.9 million
in FY2025 against $0.8 million in FY2024.
As a consequence of the above factors, the Group turned
around to deliver a profit after tax of $0.03 million in FY2025 as
compared to a loss after tax of $2.3 million in FY2024.
FINANCIAL POSITION
As at 31 March 2025, the Group registered non-current assets
of $10.3 million, which was a decrease of $2.2 million from
$12.5 million as at 31 March 2024. This was a consequence of

AN N UA L R E P O RT 2 0 2 5

09

FINANCIAL
REVIEW
depreciation charges and amortisation expenses, along with lease
modification totalling $2.8 million, partially offset by additional
investments of $0.6 million in new plant and equipment.
Current assets contracted by $3.0 million from $14.9 million as
at 31 March 2024 to $11.9 million during the reporting period as
a result of $1.4 million in inventories, prepayments, investment
securities, asset held for sale, along with decrease of $3.2 million
in cash and short-term deposits. This was partially offset by a
$1.6 million increase in trade and other receivables and contract
assets.
Separately, current liabilities registered was $14.3 million as at
31 March 2025. This translated to a decrease of $2.3 million
against $16.6 million as at 31 March 2024. The decline was
attributed to a decrease of $2.9 million in lease liabilities and
bank borrowings resulted from the settlement of the bank
overdraft, mortgage loan, and repayment of bank borrowings,
which was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in trade and
other payables.
Non-current liabilities also decreased by $3.0 million from
$8.9 million as at 31 March 2024 to $5.9 million as at 31 March
2025 as a consequence of reductions in other payable, bank
borrowings and lease liabilities, mainly due to reclassifying
portions of these to current liabilities.
As at 31 March 2025, the Group recorded a negative working
capital of $2.4 million against a negative working capital of
$1.7 million in the previous year. The Group is aware of its

financial position and has been actively taken steps to address
the negative working capital and meet the cash flow requirements.
Some of the measures implemented by the Group included
ensuring timely projects completion to achieve the projected
positive margin and net cash inflows, as well as maintaining
sufficient bank facilities and cash balances to fund the Group’s
daily operations.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT
In FY2025, the Group reported net cash used in operating
activities of $0.5 million in FY2025. This was mainly attributed to
an operating cash inflow of $2.1 million before working capital
changes and the net cash outflow of $2.6 million from changes
in working capital.
Net cash generated from investing activities stood at $1.7 million.
This was accounted by a cash inflow of $2.0 million from the
disposal of investment property, which was partially offset by
a cash outflow of $0.3 million for the purchase of plant and
equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities in FY2025 was $1.7 million
due to repayment of bank borrowings, lease liabilities and loan
interest amounting to $4.2 million. This was partially offset by
cash inflow of $2.5 million from the release of pledged fixed
deposit and new bank borrowings.

TABLE I – COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
Provisions

Code Description

Company’s Compliance or Explanation
This deviation resulted from the retirement of Professor Yong Kwet Yew on 31 July
2024. The Company recognises the importance of upholding strong corporate
governance practices, including ensuring objective and impartial decision-making by
the NC in matters such as Board appointments and performance reviews.
However, taking into account the current nature and scale of the Group’s operations,
the NC has assessed that immediate changes to its composition may cause
unnecessary disruption and may not be cost-effective. The NC is of the view that,
despite not having a majority of independent directors, the current composition
retains substantial independent oversight and is appropriate for effective and
balanced decision-making. The NC and the Board are satisfied that there remains
a strong element of independence that ensures objectivity and proper stewardship
of corporate matters.
5.

The RC comprises 3 members, the majority of whom, including the Chairman are
independent. All the members of the RC are Non-Executive Directors.

Role of Board

The Board is entrusted to lead and oversee the Group, with the fundamental
principle to act in the best interests of the Group. In addition to its statutory
duties, the Board’s principal functions are to, inter alia:
•

provide entrepreneurial leadership, set out overall long-term strategic
plans and objectives for the Group, and ensure that the necessary
financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its
objectives;

•

establish a framework of prudent and effective internal controls and risk
management strategies which enable risk to be assessed and managed,
including safeguarding of shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets;

•

review the performance of Management and key management personnel;

•

ensure good corporate governance practices to protect the interests of
shareholders;

•

Practices relating to conflict of
interest

The Board is guided by the regulations of the constitution of the Company (the
“Constitution”), which aims to avoid situations in which their own personal
or business interests, directly or indirectly conflict, or appear to conflict with
the interest of the Company. The Company has in place practices to address
potential conflicts of interests. All Directors are required to notify the Company
promptly of all conflicts of interests as soon as practicable as well as when
required and refresh the required declarations annually. Directors are required
to recuse themselves from all deliberations/voting in relation to the matters in
which they have a conflict of interest unless the Board is of the opinion that the
participation of the conflicted Directors is of the best interest to the Company.

Code of Ethics and Conduct

The Board has put in place a Code of Ethics and Conduct to create a
corporate culture within the Group to operate the business of the Group in
an ethical manner and to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and
exemplary corporate conduct.

Directors’ training and orientation

Upon the appointment of a new Director, the Company will provide the Director
with a formal letter, setting out the Director’s duties and obligations. The Board
ensures that all incoming Directors will receive comprehensive and tailored
induction on joining the Board, including briefing on his duties as a Director
and how to discharge those duties, and an orientation program to ensure that
they are familiar with the Company’s business and organisation structure,
strategic direction and governance practices as well as the expected duties
of a Director of a listed company.
The Company also provides training for any newly appointed Directors (who
have no prior experience as a Director in a listed company) in areas such as
accounting, legal and industry-specific knowledge as appropriate through
external courses. All newly appointed Directors (who have no prior experience
as a Director in a listed company) are also required to attend the relevant
training on the roles and responsibilities as a director of a listed company in
Singapore as prescribed by the SGX-ST within 1 year from the date of his
appointment in accordance with the Catalist Rules.
To get a better understanding of the Company’s business, the Director will
also be given the opportunity to visit the Company’s operational facilities and
meet with key management personnel periodically.

Appointment and removal of
Company Secretary

The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the
Board as a whole. There was no change of Company Secretary during the
financial year.

Access to Management and
Company Secretary

Directors have separate and independent access to the Management
and Company Secretary at all times. The Company Secretary and her
representatives attend all Board and Board Committees’ meetings and
are responsible to ensure that board procedures are followed and that the
Constitution of the Company, Catalist Rules and other relevant rules and
regulations applicable to the Company are complied with. The Company
Secretary and her representatives assist the Management in ensuring that
the Company complies with rules and regulations which are applicable to the
Company.

Access to professional advice

Individually or collectively, in order to execute their duties, Directors can obtain
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense when required.

BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE
Principle 2: The Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to
enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.
2.1
2.2
2.3

Board Composition

The Board has adopted the criteria on an independent director given in
Provision 2.1 of the Code and Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules. The
independence of each Director is reviewed annually by the NC in accordance
with the guidance provided in the Code. No individual or group of individuals
dominates the Board’s decision making.
As at the date of this report, the Non-Executive Directors make up a majority
of the Board which is in compliance with Provision 2.3 of the Code. The Board
composition does not meet the requirement under Provision 2.2 of the Code
to have independent directors making up a majority of the Board where the
chairman of the Board is not independent. The NC is of the view that the
current Board size and composition are appropriate for the time being for
the facilitation of effective decision making on the part of the Board, taking
into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations and the need to
avoid undue disruptions from changes to the composition of the Board and
Board Committees.
The NC is of the opinion that, given the current scope and nature of
the Group’s operations, it is neither necessary nor cost-effective to have
Independent Directors making up majority of the Board. The present
composition of the Board demonstrates independence and is appropriate for
effective decision making. The NC is of the view that the existing Independent
Directors have demonstrated a strong level of independence and judgement
in discharging their duties and responsibilities as Independent Directors of
the Company with the utmost commitment in upholding the interests of the
non-controlling shareholders through expressing individual and independent
viewpoints, debating issues, and objectively scrutinising and challenging the
rationale, premises, assumptions of proposals during Board meetings. The
NC and the Board are satisfied that the Board has substantial independent
elements to ensure that objective judgment is exercised on corporate affair.

Independence Assessment of
Directors

The Board considers the existence of relationships or circumstances,
including those identified by the Code and the Catalist Rules that are
relevant to determine whether a Director is independent. In addition, the NC
annually reviews the individual director’s declaration in their assessment of
independence, and as and when circumstances require.
None of the Non-Executive and Independent Directors and their immediate
family member are a substantial shareholder of or partner in or an executive
officer of or a director of, any organisation to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries made, or from which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
received, significant payments or materials services aggregated over any
financial year in excess of $50,000 (to an individual) or $200,000 (to a firm),
which may include auditing, banking, consulting and legal services, in the
current or immediate past financial year.
The NC has reviewed and confirmed that the independence of the Independent
Directors is in accordance with the Code, PG and Catalist Rules. The
Independent Directors have also confirmed their independence in accordance
with the Code, PG and Catalist Rules. The NC members, Mr Ong Eng Keang
and Mr Tan Chade Phang have abstained from participating in the discussion
and voting on any resolution related to his independence. The Company would
continue to build on the acquired experience and expertise by preserving
continuity and stability through orderly succession.

Board diversity

The Board has adopted a Board Diversity Policy to assist the NC and the
Board in identifying prospective candidates for Directorship that meet the
criteria as determined by the NC and that support the diversity’s objectives.
The Board Diversity Policy promotes the diversity among the Directors in
order to improve performance and to avoid groupthink and foster constructive
debate and ensure that composition is optimal to support the Group’s needs
in the short and long term. The diversity includes the appropriate mix of
complementary skills, business and industry experience, gender, age, ethnicity,
geographic background, length of service and other distinctive qualities of the
board members. The Company recognises that an effective board requires
Directors to possess not only integrity, commitment, relevant experiences,
qualifications and skills in carrying out their duties effectively but also include
diverse background towards promoting good corporate governance. The NC
will discuss and agree on the relevant measurable objectives to ensure the
existing skill sets and core competencies of the Board are complementary
and enhances the efficacy of the Board for promoting and achieving diversity
on the Board are assessed from time to time and make recommendations for
consideration and approval by the Board based on the composition of the
Board and operations of the Group at the relevant time.

As there is currently no female Director appointed to the Board, the Board
does not rule out the possibility of appointing a female Director if a suitable
candidate is nominated for the Board’s consideration. The composition of
the Board is reviewed on an annual basis by the NC to ensure that the Board
has the appropriate mix of skills, knowledge, expertise, experience, diversity
and gender, and collectively possesses the necessary core competencies for
effective functioning and informed decision-making. The NC has not set a
specific target for board diversity as it may detract from the more fundamental
principle that the candidate must be of the right fit and meet the relevant
needs and vision of the Company. The NC shall endeavour to ensure that
female candidates are included for consideration when identifying candidates
to be appointed as new Directors. The NC will review and modify this Board
Diversity Policy periodically, as appropriate, to ensure effective governance
of the Company.

Role of Chairman and Managing
Director

The Group’s policy is to have a distinct separation of responsibilities between
the role of Non-Executive Chairman and Managing Director in order to provide
an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability and greater
capacity of the Board for independent decision-making. Mr Aw Eng Hai is
the Non-Executive Chairman and Dr Wang Xiaoning is the Managing Director
of the Company. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the
Non-Executive Chairman and the Managing Director, which ensures there is
a balance of power and authority, and that accountability and independent
decision-making are not compromised.
The Managing Director has full executive responsibilities in the business
directions and operational efficiency of the Group. He oversees the execution
of the Group’s corporate and business strategies and is responsible for the
day-to-day running of the business.
The Non-Executive Chairman oversees the business of the Board. He leads
the board discussion and ensures that board meetings are convened when
necessary. He sets the board’s meeting agenda in consultation with the
Managing Director and ensures that quality, quantity and timely information

Both the Chairman and the Managing Director are not related to each other.
The Non-Executive Chairman is not part of the Management. The Board is
of the view that there are sufficient safeguards and checks that the process
of decision making by the Board is independent and based on collective
decisions, without any individual or group of individuals exercising any
considerable concentration of power or influence.

the appointment of the Lead Independent Director is not necessary.

The NC is guided by the terms of reference and its key functions are as
follows:
(a)

a Director is independent, and providing its views to the Board in relation

The Board is also advised by the Company’s sponsor on appointment of
Directors as required under Catalist Rule 226(2)(d).
Pursuant to Regulation 117 of the Constitution, at least one-third of the
Directors are required to retire by rotation and submit themselves for
re-election at each AGM of the Company while Regulation 122 of the
Constitution states that new Director shall hold office until the next AGM and
shall be eligible for re-election. Pursuant to Rule 720(4) of the Catalist Rules,
all Directors shall retire by rotation at least once every three years and such
retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election.
The NC, with the respective members interested in the discussion having
abstained from the deliberations, recommended that Dr Wang Xiaoning and
Mr Tan Chade Phang be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM to
be held on 29 July 2025 in accordance to Regulation 117 of the Constitution.
Dr Wang Xiaoning, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain
as the Managing Director of the Company and a member of NC. Mr Tan
Chade Phang, upon re-election as Director of the Company, will remain as
Independent Director of the Company, Chairman of the AC and RC and a
member of NC. The Board considers Mr Tan Chade Phang to be independent
for the purpose of Rule 704(7) of the Catalist Rules.
Pursuant to Rule 720(5) of the Catalist Rules, the additional information set
out in Appendix 7F of the Catalist Rules relating to Dr Wang Xiaoning and
Mr Tan Chade Phang who are seeking re-election is disclosed below and is to
be read in conjunction with their respective biographies under the respective

Assessment of Directors’ ability to
discharge duties

As part of the assessment of Directors’ performance, the NC assesses if
Directors are able to and have been adequately carrying out their duties,
taking into account the multiple directorships and principal commitments of
the Directors.
Assessment of the individual Directors’ performance was based on the
criteria set out in Section 5.1 of Table I. The following were used to assess
the performance and consider competing time commitments of the Directors:
•

Declarations by each Director of their other listed company directorships
and principal commitments; and

•

Annual confirmations by each Director on his ability to devote sufficient
time and attention to the Company’s affairs, having regard to his other
commitments.

Multiple Directorships

The NC had reviewed the time spent and attention given by each of
the Directors to the Company’s affairs, taking into account the multiple
directorships and principal commitments of each of the Directors and is
satisfied that all Directors were able to diligently discharge their duties for
FY2025.
The NC took into account the results of the assessment of the performance
of the Director, the level of commitment required of the Director’s other
directorships or principal commitments, and the Director’s actual conduct and
participation on the Board and Board Committees, including availability and
attendance at regular scheduled meetings and ad-hoc meetings, in making
the determination, and is satisfied that such Directors have been able to and
have adequately carried out their duties as Director notwithstanding their other
directorships or principal commitments.
Some specific considerations which may be relevant in assessing the capacity
of Directors include:
•

expected and/or competing time commitments of Directors, including
whether such commitment is a full-time or part-time employment capacity

•

geographical location of Directors

•

size and composition of the Board

•

nature and scope of the Group’s operations and size

•

capacity, complexity and expectations of the other listed directorships
and principal commitments held.

A list of the other listed company directorships and principal commitments of
each of the Directors for FY2025 is set out on pages 12 to 13 of this Annual
Report.
The Board has not capped the maximum number of listed company board
representations each Director may hold.
The Board with the concurrence of the NC, has agreed that the Company shall
not impose a maximum number of listed company board representations on
the Directors as the Board is of the opinion that setting a fixed number would
not adequately take into account the varied circumstances of each Director,
and the effectiveness of each of the Directors is best assessed by a qualitative
assessment of the Director’s contributions, after taking into account his other
listed company board directorships and other principal commitments, not
guided by a numerical limit.

outstanding individuals who, despite the demands of their time, have the
capacity to participate and contribute as members of the Board.

principal business activities and markets which it operates in, necessary core
competencies to meet the Group’s needs, with the objective to enhance long

The NC did not propose any changes to the performance criteria and
continued to use the respective evaluation questionnaire based on the Code
for the performance of the Board, the Board Committees and individual
Directors for FY2025, inter alia, as the Group’s principal business activities
and markets which it operates in remained largely the same.

5.2

Performance Review

The Board has implemented a structure process to be carried out by the NC to
evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole, its Board
Committees and individual Directors annually. The NC has met to discuss
the evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and
individual Directors; and has adopted a formal evaluation process to assess
the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. Any recommendation and
suggestion arising from the evaluation exercise are circulated to the Board
for consideration and appropriate measures are taken. This encourages
constructive feedback from the Board and leads to an enhancement of its
performance from time to time.
In FY2025, the review process was as follows:
1.

All Directors individually completed a board evaluation questionnaire
on the effectiveness of the Board and the Board Committees based on
criteria disclosed in Section 5.1 of Table I.

2.

The results of such assessment were collated and submitted to the NC
Chairman who reviewed it together with the NC.

3.

The NC discussed the report and where applicable considered and made
recommendations to the Board on any appropriate follow up actions to
be undertaken.

No external facilitator was used in the evaluation process. However, if need
arises, the NC has full authority to engage external facilitator to assist the NC
to carry out the evaluation process at the Company’s expense.
In FY2025, in relation to the rigorous assessment that was completed by
the Directors, the Directors have on a whole assessed the performance
of the Board, the Board Committees and individual Directors to be good
and acceptable, and there were no particular issues or concerns that were
highlighted. On this basis, the Board has met its performance objectives.

Role of the RC

The RC is guided by the terms of reference and its key functions include:
(a)

Review and recommend to the Board a general framework of
remuneration and specific remuneration packages for each Director and
key management personnel;

(b)

Consider and approve termination payments, retirement payments,
gratuities, ex-gratia payment, severance payments and other similar
payments to each member of key management personnel;

(c)

Review all aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to Directors’
fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based incentives,
awards and benefits-in-kind;

in its deliberation.
6.4

Engagement of Remuneration
Consultants

No remuneration consultants were engaged by the Company in FY2025 for
the remuneration packages of its Directors and key management personnel
as the Company is of the view that the annual review by the RC, giving due
regard to prevailing market conditions as well as the financial, commercial
health and business needs of the Group, is currently sufficient to ensure the
continued relevance of such remuneration packages to the Group’s strategic
business objectives and alignment with market practices.

“Claw-back” Provisions

There are no contractual provisions which allow the Company to reclaim
incentives from the Executive Directors and key management personnel in
certain circumstances. The Board is of the view that as the Group pays
performance bonuses based on the actual performance of the Group and/or
Company (and not on forward-looking results) as well as the actual results of
its Executive Directors and key management personnel, “claw-back” provisions
in the service agreements may not be relevant or appropriate.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
Principle 9: The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk
management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.
9.1

Risk Governance by the Board

The Board is responsible for the overall risk governance, risk management and
internal control framework of the Group. The Board has in place a system of
internal controls within the Group to safeguard shareholders’ interests and the
Group’s assets, and to manage risks. The Board also oversees Management
in the design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and
internal control systems and is responsible for determining the Company’s
risk policies and level of risk tolerance.

Identification of the Group’s Risks

The Group has in place a structured and systematic approach to risk
management and aims to mitigate the exposures through appropriate risk
management strategies and internal controls, which parameters have been
reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis. Risk management
in the Group is a continuous, iterative and integrated process which has been
incorporated into various planning, approval, execution, monitoring, review
and reporting systems. The Group adopts a top-down as well as bottom-up
approach on risk management to ensure strategic, business, operational,
financial, reporting, compliance and information technology risk exposures
are identified and appropriately managed.

Management of Risk

Given the nature and size of the Group’s business and operations, the
Company has not established a separate Risk Management Committee.
Instead, the review of the Group’s risk management and internal control
systems including, financial, operational, compliance and information
technology controls, falls under the purview of the AC. The Directors and
the AC reviews all significant control policies and procedures of the Group
on a periodic basis, including through the annual internal audits conducted
by the IA.
Where there were no material weaknesses identified, the Board noted that
there are some areas requiring improvement as identified by the IA during the
course of their audit performed in FY2025. The Board has accepted the IA’s
recommendations and has implemented the recommendations to address
such deficiencies identified.
The Board noted that the system of internal controls and risk management
established by the Company provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
that the Company will not be adversely affected by any event that could be
reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this
regard, the Board also noted that no system of internal controls and risk
management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of
material errors, poor judgment in decision making, human error, losses, fraud
or other irregularities.

Confirmation of Internal Controls

The Board with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group’s
internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information
technology risks) and risk management systems were adequate and effective
for FY2025.
The bases for the Board’s view are as follows:
1.

assurance has been received from the Managing Director and Head of
Finance that the financial records have been properly maintained and the
financial statements give a true and fair view of the company’s operations
and finances, and the Company’s risk management and internal control
systems are adequate and effective;

2.

an internal audit has been done by the IA, and significant matters
highlighted to the AC and key management personnel were appropriately
addressed;

3.

key management personnel evaluate, monitor material risks and report
to the AC on a regular basis; and

4.

discussions were held between the AC and auditors in the absence of
Management to review and address any potential concerns.

The Board has also relied on the EA’s report as set out in this Annual Report
that the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the Company’s
financial position and performance.
The Board has additionally relied on IA’s report issued to the Company in
respect of FY2025 as assurances that the Company’s risk management
and internal control systems to the matters reported upon are adequate and
sufficiently effective.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Principle 10: The Board has an Audit Committee (“AC”) which discharges its duties objectively.

Role of the AC

All members of the AC are Non-Executive and the majority of whom are
Independent Directors. All members of the AC do not have any management
and business relationships with the Company or any substantial shareholder of
the Company. None of the AC members were previously partners or directors
of the Company’s external audit firm within a period of two years commencing
on the date of their ceasing to be a partner of the external audit firm and none
of the AC members hold any financial interest in the external audit firm.

(g)

reviewing interested person transactions in accordance with the Catalist
Rules.

The AC has in consultation with the Board, initiated the implementation of a
fraud and whistle-blowing policy and incorporated the whistle-blowing policy
into the Company’s internal control procedures to provide a channel for all
employees and other persons including employees of the Company’s overseas
subsidiaries to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals,
concerns about possible improprieties, suspected fraud, corruption, dishonest
practices in matter of financial reporting or other matters. The objective of
the policy is to ensure an independent investigation of such matters and for
appropriate follow-up actions and seeks to encourage reporting in good faith
of suspected improprieties (e.g. conduct that is dishonest, fraudulent, corrupt,
illegal, other serious improper conduct, unsafe work practice or any other
conduct which may cause financial or non-financial loss to the Company or
damage to the Company’s reputation). The AC is responsible for oversight
and monitoring of whistle blowing.
While the policy aims to provide an avenue for employees to raise concerns
with the reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimisation
for whistle-blowing in good faith, a person who files a report or provides
evidence which he/she knows to be false, or without a reasonable belief
in the truth and accuracy of such information, will not be protected by the
whistle-blowing policy and may be subject to administrative and/or disciplinary
action. Similarly, a person may be subject to administrative and/or disciplinary
action if he/she subjects (i) a person who has made or intends to make a
report in accordance with the whistle-blowing policy, or (ii) a person who was
called or may be called as a witness, to any form of reprisal which would not
have occurred if he/she did not intend to, or had not made the report, or be
a witness. The details of the whistle-blowing policy are made available to all
employees.

Internal Audit Function

The Company does not have an in-house internal audit function.
The Company’s internal audit function is outsourced to In.Corp Business
Advisory Pte. Ltd. (“INCORP”). INCORP offers diversified business advisory
services in Singapore and overseas, including secretarial and compliance,
share registry, accounting and finance, tax advisory, human resource and
immigration, business advisory, fund administration and family office, and
internal audit and risk assurance.
The internal audit engagement team comprises of an Engagement Director
(Ms Ruby Rouben), Engagement Senior Manager (Ms Kwok Jing Yi) and other
team members. Ms Ruby Rouben is the Head of Risk Assurance Services and
she has more than 14 years of experience in the audit profession. Ms Ruby
Rouben has led the internal audit, governance advisory and risk management
engagements with various Ministries, Organs of State, Statutory Boards,
Institutions of Higher Learning, Multinationals, Public Listed Companies,
Financial Institutions, Charities and Institutions of a Public Character.
INCORP reports directly to the AC Chairman on any material weaknesses and
risks identified in the course of the audit and administratively to the Managing
Director. Management would update the AC on the status of the remedial
action plans. The AC is responsible for the hiring, removal, evaluation and
compensation of the accounting or auditing firm or corporation to whom the
internal audit function of the Company is outsourced to. The AC reviews and
approves the internal audit plan to ensure the adequacy of the scope of audit.
The internal audit work carried out in FY2025 was guided by the International
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (“IIA Standards”)
laid down in the International Professional Practices Framework issued by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.
The AC is satisfied and is of the opinion that INCORP is independent, effective,
adequately qualified and resourced, and has the appropriate standing in the
Company to discharge its duties effectively given, inter alia, its involvement in
certain AC meetings and its unfettered access to all the Group’s documents,
records, properties and personnel, including direct access to the AC. INCORP
has provided a confirmation on their independence to the AC.

Share Options
On 22 March 2022, the Company entered into a placement agreement (“Placement Agreement”) with the Placees for the
placement of up to 742,166,667 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (“Placement Shares”) to the Placees
over two tranches, for an aggregate cash consideration of up to S$33,775,000 (“Proposed Placement”). Under the Proposed

S$0.03 per Placement Share and 575,500,000 Placement Shares under the Second Tranche at the issue price of S$0.05
per Placement Share.
On 4 May 2022, the Company and the Placees entered into a supplemental agreement to the original Placement Agreement
(“Supplemental Agreement”) pursuant to which they have agreed that instead of retaining the conditional agreement for the
Company to allot and issue, and the Placees to subscribe for, a second tranche of the Placement Shares in accordance
with the terms of the original Placement Agreement, the Company shall grant a call option to each of the Placees in respect
of such Placee’s relevant proportion of the option shares, and each of the Placees shall grant a put option to the Company
in respect of such Placee’s relevant proportion of the option shares (“Proposed Option grant”), pursuant to which, upon the
exercise of the relevant options, the Company shall allot and issue, and the Placees shall subscribe for effectively the same
number of shares, at the same price and on substantively the same conditions and terms for the allotment and issuance of
such shares as was originally contemplated in relation to the Second Tranche Placement Shares.
The Proposed Options are subject to
(i)

The allotment and issuance of all of the 575,500,000 Second Tranche Placement Shares, and

(ii)

To seek a ruling from the SIC that the Placees are not persons acting in concert with each other, or alternatively, to
seek the Whitewash Waiver from the SIC to waive the obligation of the Concert arising from the allotment and offer
of the Second Tranche Placement Shares to the Placees, to make an offer for all the Shares not owned or controlled
by the Placees and their concert parties.

Share Options (Continued)
On 7 June 2022, the Company had completed the allotment and issuance of the Placement Shares to the Placees.
On 17 October 2022, the Company received a ruling from the SIC (“SIC Ruling”) that the Placees are parties acting in concert
with respect to the Company; and the Placees will not be required to make a general offer for the Company pursuant to
Rule 14.1 of the Code in the event the Placees acquire 30% or more of the voting rights of the Company based on the
Company’s enlarged issued capital as a result of the acquisition of the Option Shares by the Placees, subject to the conditions
of the SIC Ruling.
On 18 November 2022, the Company entered into Second Supplemental Agreement to extend the Options Exercise Period
for the Proposed Options Grant from six months from the date of the allotment and issuance of the First Tranche Placement
Shares to twelve months from the date of the allotment and issuance of the First Tranche Placement Shares, or such other
date as the Parties may agree to in writing. With this extension, the Options Exercise Period expired on 7 June 2023.
Under the Supplemental Agreement read with the Second Supplemental Agreement, subject to the performance and fulfilment
of the Options Conditions Precedent and in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Supplemental Agreement,
the Company agrees to grant each Placee, at nil consideration, a call option to require the Company to allot and issue to such
Placee its Relevant Proportion of the Option Shares and each Placee agrees to grant the Company, at nil consideration, a
put option to require such Placee to subscribe for its Relevant Proportion of the Option Shares at the option exercise price
of S$0.05 for each Option Share.
An Option may only be exercised subject to and conditional upon the performance or fulfilment of the Options Conditions
Precedent and within the period of 12 months from the date of the allotment and issuance of the Placement Shares (“Options
Exercise Period”). Any Option shall be exercised before the expiry of the Options Exercise Period, failing which such
unexercised Option shall immediately lapse and become null and void.
On 23 December 2022, an Extraordinary General Meeting was held that the proposed options grant and the allotment and
issuance of 575,500,000 Option Shares to the Placees was approved pursuant to the exercise of the relevant options.
On 7 June 2023, the Parties entered into a Third Supplemental Agreement to extend the Options Exercise Period for the
Proposed Options Grant for a further six months from 7 June 2023 to 7 December 2023, or such other date as the Parties
may agree to in writing. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Third Supplemental Agreement, in the event that the Options
have not been exercised on or prior to 7 December 2023, unless otherwise mutually agreed by all Parties, the Options Exercise
Period shall automatically be renewed for a further six months to 7 June 2024.
On 4 June 2024, the Company and the Placees (collectively referred to as the “Parties”) entered into a Fourth Supplemental

Exercise Period, the Placees shall pay the Company a deposit of US$1,000,000, within thirty days from the Effective Date
of the Fourth Supplemental Agreement. The Deposit may be used to offset against the consideration payable by a relevant
Placee for its relevant proportion of the Option Shares upon the exercise of options in relation to such Placee.

Share Options (Continued)
On 16 December 2024, the Company received a letter from Protocol Capital, dated 9 December 2024 in relation to the
Company’s exercise of the Put Option against Protocol Capital (“Letter”). In its Letter, Protocol Capital had proposed for
a further extension of the Options Exercise Period by an additional three months till 9 March 2025 to facilitate its funds for
this specific placement. Protocol Capital had also assured the Company that it is financially sound and keen to invest in the
Company. In connection therewith, Protocol Capital had also proposed to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the Option,
including but not limited to the Option Exercise Price, in view of the substantial changes in market conditions since the original
placement agreement and subsequent supplemental agreements were entered into.
As at the date of authorisation of the financial statements, the Company remains in discussions with Protocol Capital to finalise
the execution of the investment agreement and will announce any developments promptly.
Except as disclosed above, there were no options granted by the Company or its subsidiaries to any person to take up

INDEPENDENT
AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF TRITECH GROUP LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Tritech Group Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”),
which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and statement of financial position of the Company
as at 31 March 2025, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material
accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the
Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial
Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group
and the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2025 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes
in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of
the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics
for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of
the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and
the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern
We draw attention to Note 2.1 of the financial statements. Notwithstanding that the Group recorded a net profit of S$31,690 and a
total comprehensive income of S$34,190 (2024: net loss of S$2,318,183 and total comprehensive loss of S$2,319,547) for the financial
year ended 31 March 2025, the Group’s and the Company’s net current liabilities amounted to S$2,446,934 (2024: S$1,710,797) and
S$5,197,686 (2024: S$3,282,995) respectively as at that date. These factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which
may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group and the Company to continue as going concerns.
The directors are of the view that it is appropriate to prepare financial statements of the Group and of the Company on a going
concern basis for reasons disclosed in Note 2.1 to the financial statements. If the Group and the Company are unable to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, the Group and the Company may be unable to discharge their liabilities in the
normal course of business and adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other
than in the normal course of business and at amounts which could differ from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the
statements of financial position. In addition, the Group and the Company may have to reclassify non-current assets and non-current
liabilities as current assets and current liabilities respectively. No such adjustments have been made to these financial statements.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF TRITECH GROUP LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described
in the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit
matters to be communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Accounting for revenue recognition

Our response

We refer to Note 2.22(a), Note 3(b)(i) and Note 4 to the financial We have performed the following key audit procedures:
statements.
• Updated our understanding of the Group’s processes and
controls for the initiation of the budgeted cost, budgeted
During the financial year ended 31 March 2025, the Group’s
revenue and monitoring processes;
revenue amounted to S$24.77 million of which S$24.77 million
was derived from services rendered and recognised over time.

•

The amount of revenue recognised over time is based on the
Group’s progress towards completion of the various geotechnical
projects, determined based on the proportion of the actual costs
incurred to date to the estimated budgeted costs for each project
(“input method”). The Group uses the input method to measure
project progress and recognises contract revenue in accordance
with SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. If the
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract
exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received for the •
contract, a provision for onerous contract is recognised.
The determination of estimated revenue, total contract costs
and costs to complete require significant judgement which may
impact on the amounts of revenue and profits recognised during
the year, including the provision for onerous contracts. These
uncertainties are partly due to the nature of the operations, which
may be impacted by the geotechnical complexity of projects, the
precision of cost estimation during the budgeting process and •
the actual progress of each project during the financial year. We
have therefore, identified this as a key audit matter.

Assessed the reasonableness of the basis used by
management in determining the total contract revenue and
revenue recognised by reviewing the contractual terms and
conditions of the projects and their contractual sums, testing
project revenues and the actual costs incurred-to-date
against underlying supporting documents to determine the
satisfaction of performance obligation of the projects and
assessing management’s judgement in recognising variation
orders from customers;
Reviewed the Group’s project correspondences with
customers and subcontractors, and discussed the progress
of the projects with project managers to identify any potential
disputes, variation order claims, known technical issues
or significant events that could impact the estimated total
contract costs. We also analysed changes in the estimation of
costs and profits from prior periods and inquired management
on the reasons;
Performed re-computation of the revenue to be recognised
based on percentage of completion and checked to the
mathematical accuracy;

•

Reviewed the budgeted costs for inadequacy by assessing
the reasonableness of the remaining costs to be incurred to
complete the projects. We evaluated management’s estimates
of the remaining budgeted revenue and budgeted cost of
the projects, taking into consideration the effect of variation
orders, contingencies and any known technical issues.
We also evaluated management’s assessment of onerous
contracts for the ongoing projects; and

•

Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures of the key
accounting estimates and the sensitivity of the inputs to
the estimates and found the disclosures in the financial
statements to be appropriate.

Our findings
We found the areas of judgements and estimates applied by
management in the recognition of revenue from projects to be
reasonable and the relevant disclosures made in the financial
statements to be adequate.

but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT
AUDITOR’S REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF TRITECH GROUP LIMITED

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)
Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions
of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised
and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability
of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout
the audit. We also:
•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•

Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

AUDITOR’S REPORT

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the
financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that
a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations
incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Lao Mei Leng.

NOTES TO
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2025

These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements:
1

GENERAL INFORMATION
Tritech Group Limited (the “Company”) is a limited liability company, which is incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and
is listed on the Catalist board of the SGX-ST.
The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is located at 31 Changi South Avenue 2, Singapore
486478.
The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding and provision of management services. The principal
activities of the subsidiaries and associates are disclosed in Note 12 and Note 13 to the financial statements respectively.
The financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution
of the Board of Directors of the Company on the date of the Directors’ Statement.

2

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1

Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards
(International) (“SFRS(I)s”) under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I)s requires management to exercise its judgement
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates and assumptions. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.
The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollar (“S$”) except when otherwise indicated.
Fundamental accounting concept – Going Concern assessment
Notwithstanding that the Group recorded a net profit of S$31,690 and a total comprehensive income of S$34,190 (2024:
net loss of S$2,318,183 and total comprehensive loss of S$2,319,547) for the financial year ended 31 March 2025, the
Group’s and the Company’s net current liabilities amounted to S$2,446,934 (2024: S$1,710,797) and S$5,197,686
(2024: S$3,282,995) respectively as at that date. These factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which
may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group and the Company to continue as going concerns.
Notwithstanding the above, the directors are of the view that it is appropriate to prepare these financial statements
on a going concern basis after considering the following in the cashflow forecast for the next 12 months from the
date of these financial statements:
(a)

The Group will be able to complete its projects as scheduled and achieve the projected positive margin and
net cash inflows;

(b)

The Group has sufficient bank facilities and cash balances to fund their daily operations;

(c)

Its subsidiaries currently have new projects in the tendering process and expect a reasonable possibility of
securing some of these contracts. The successful award of these projects is expected to contribute positively
to future revenue and cash flows, strengthening the Group’s ability to maintain its operations and financial
position;

(d)

The Group expects to exercise the put option relating to the Second Tranche of Placement Shares, subject to
the finalisation of the investment agreement with Protocol Capital as disclosed in the “Share Options” section
under the Directors’ Statement, and to receive the proceeds to meet its obligations as and when they fall due;
and

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.1

Basis of Preparation (Continued)
(e)

The Group is exploring potential fundraising and/or alternative financing options to enhance the Group’s access
to additional capital as needed.

If the Group and the Company are unable to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, the Group
and the Company may be unable to discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business and adjustments
may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be realised other than in the normal course of
business and at amounts which could differ from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the statements of
financial position. In addition, the Group and the Company may have to reclassify non-current assets and non-current
liabilities as current assets and current liabilities respectively. No such adjustments have been made to these financial
statements.
2.2

Adoption of New and Amended Standards and Interpretations
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except that in the current
financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and amended standards which are relevant to the Group and are
effective for annual financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2024. The adoption of these standards did not have
any material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group and the Company.

2.3

Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective
The Group has not adopted the following standards that have been issued but not yet effective:

Description
Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates:
Lack of Exchangeability
Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments and SFRS(I) 7 Financial Instruments:
Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments
Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments and SFRS(I) 7 Financial Instruments:

Annual Improvements to SFRS(I)s – Volume 11
SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
SFRS(I) 19: Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures
Amendments to SFRS(I) 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and SFRS(I) 1-28
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

Effective for Annual
periods beginning
on or after
1 January 2025
1 January 2026
1 January 2026
1 January 2026
1 January 2027
1 January 2027

Date to be determined

SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
This standard will replace SFRS(I)1-1 Presentation of Financial Statements. Whilst many of the requirements will
remain consistent, the new standard will have impacts on the presentation of the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss and consequential impacts on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. It will also require the disclosure
of the non-SFRS(I) management performance measures and may impact the level of aggregation and disaggregation
throughout the primary financial statements and the notes.
An entity is required to apply the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2027. Earlier application is permitted. SFRS(I) 18 requires retrospective application with specific transition
provisions.
Other than the above, the Group expects that the adoption of the standards above will have no material impact on
the financial statements in the year of initial application.

Foreign Currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company’s
functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial
statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
a.

Transactions and Balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its
subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating
those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the
date of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end
of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.
Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment in foreign
operations are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency
translation reserve in the equity. The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit
or loss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operations.

b.

Consolidated Financial Statements
For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into S$ at the rate of
exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange rates
prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised
in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive
income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.

2.5

Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the investee.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment
losses.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.6

Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the
end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are
applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions
and dividends are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.

2.7

Transactions with Non-Controlling Interests
Non-controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the
Company.
Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests
are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by
which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised
directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

2.8

Property, Plant and Equipment
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and
equipment other than leasehold properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Motor vehicles
Furniture, fittings and fixtures
Machinery, instrumentation and tools
Office equipment
Renovation

–
–
–
–
–

5 – 6 years
5 – 10 years
4 – 20 years
3 – 10 years
5 – 10 years

Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet
available for use.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjusted
prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on de-recognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the
year the asset is derecognised.

2.9

Investment Properties
Investment properties are properties that are either owned by the Group or right-of-use assets that are held to earn
rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for
administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment properties comprise completed investment
properties and properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties.
Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.
Transfers are made to (or from) investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment
property to owner-occupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of
change in use. If owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group accounts for such property
in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.

2.10

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. Following initial acquisition, intangible assets
are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated
intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in profit
or loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment
whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation
method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern
of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation
period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at
the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an
indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable.
If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
a.

Club Memberships
Transferable individual club memberships are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at
cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

b.

Research and Development Expenditures
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Deferred development expenditures arising on an individual project
are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing
the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or
sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to complete
and the ability to measure reliably the expenditures during the development.
Following initial recognition of the deferred development expenditures as an intangible asset, it is carried at cost
less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the intangible asset
begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. Deferred development costs have a
finite useful life and are amortised over the period of expected sales from the related project of 10 years on
a straight-line basis.

c.

Intangible Assets Acquired Separately
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired
in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets acquired separately are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.
Intangible assets acquired separately are amortised on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
as follows:
Intellectual property right
Software

2.11

–
–

1 – 20 years
7 years

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, or when annual impairment assessment for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of
the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal
and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or
cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss, except for assets that are previously revalued where the revaluation
was taken to other comprehensive income. In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive
income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount
of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is
recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is measured at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
•

Raw materials: purchase costs on a first-in first-out basis.

•

Finished goods and work-in-progress: costs of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing
overheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a first-in first-out basis.

Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow-moving items to adjust the carrying value
of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.13

Associate
An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy
decisions of the investee but does not have control of those policies.
The Group accounts for its investment in an associate using the equity method from the date on which it becomes
an associate.
On acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value
of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the
investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities
over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate’s
profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. The profit or loss reflects the share of
results of the operations of the associate. Distributions received from the associate reduces the carrying amount of
the investment. Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the associate, the
Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting
from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates.
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional
impairment loss on the Group’s investment in an associate. The Group determines at the end of each reporting
period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the
Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and
its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.

Financial Instruments
a.

Financial Assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the financial instrument.
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the
financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed
in profit or loss.
Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in
exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf
of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.
Subsequent measurement
Investments in debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classification
of debt instruments are:
(i)

Amortised cost
Financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows
represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and through
amortisation process.

(ii)

Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”)
Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial
assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured
at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains
or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive
income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated
using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a
reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is de-recognised.

(iii)

Fair value through profit or loss
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through
profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at fair value through
profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which it arises.

Financial Assets (Continued)
Subsequent measurement (Continued)
Investments in equity instruments
On initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may
irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income which will not
be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are to be recognised in profit
or loss when the Group’s right to receive payments is established, except when the Group benefits from such
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in
other comprehensive income.
For investments in equity instruments which the Group has not elected to present subsequent changes in fair
value in other comprehensive income, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
De-recognition
A financial asset is de-recognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired.
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of
the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
income is recognised in profit or loss.

b.

Financial Liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial
recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value
through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or
loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.
De-recognition
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
On derecognition, the difference between the carrying amounts and the consideration paid is recognised in
profit or loss.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.15

Impairment of Financial Assets
The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair value
through profit or loss and financial guarantee contracts. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual
cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted
at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the
sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
ECLs are recognised in two stages under the general approach. For credit exposures for which there has not been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default
events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there
has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses
expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the
group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
For debt instruments at FVOCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group
evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable
information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal
credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in
credit risk when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.
The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in
certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account
any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation
of recovering the contractual cash flows.

2.16

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in values. These also include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

2.17

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is
no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is
reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that
reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Financial Guarantee
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms
of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantees are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial guarantees are measured at
the higher of the amount of expected credit loss determined in accordance with the policy set out in Note 2.15 and
the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised over the period
of the guarantee.

2.19

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare
the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing
costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing
costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs
in connection with the borrowing of funds.

2.20

Employee Benefits
a.

Defined Contribution Plans
The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has
operations. In particular, the Singapore companies in the Group make contributions to the Central Provident
Fund scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to defined contribution
pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

b.

Employee Leave Entitlement
Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the employees.
The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the
reporting period is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.
The liability for leave expected to be settled beyond twelve months from the end of the reporting period is
determined using the projected unit credit method. The net total of service costs, net interest on the liability
and remeasurement of the liability are recognised in profit or loss.

c.

Employee share award plans
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share awards as consideration for services
rendered. The cost of these equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is measured by
reference to the fair value of the awards at the date on which the awards are granted which takes into account
market conditions and non-vesting conditions. This cost is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding
increase in the employee share award reserve, over the vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised
at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and
the Group’s best estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to profit or
loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of
that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.
The employee share award reserve is transferred to retained earnings upon expiry of the share award. When
the share awards are vested, the employee share award reserve is transferred to share capital if new shares
are issued.

Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a Lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
a.

Right-of-Use Assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying
asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets
includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at
or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the lease term of 60 months.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.11.

b.

Lease Liabilities
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of lease payments at the commencement date
of the lease. It consists of the following lease payments throughout the lease term:
•

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;

•

variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate
as at the commencement date;

•

amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;

•

the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option; and

•

payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that
option.

Variable lease payments that are not based on an index or rate, are expensed in the relevant period that they
are incurred.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is
used, being the rate the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms security and conditions.

Lease Liabilities (Continued)
Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost, and are remeasured when:
•

there is a change in future lease payments arising from changes in an index or rate;

•

there is a change in the Group’s assessment of whether it will exercise lease extension and termination
options;

•

there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value
guarantee; or

•

there is a modification to the lease term.

Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
c.

Short-Term Leases and Leases of Low-Value Assets
The Group applies the short-term leases recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that
have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option).
It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low
value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

Group as a Lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are
classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. The accounting
policy for rental income is set out in Note 2.22(d). Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which
they are earned.
2.22

Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring
promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service
to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may
be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied
performance obligation.
a.

Revenue from geotechnical projects
The Group is involved in geotechnical projects whereby they are restricted contractually from directing the
product for another use as they are being performed and has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date. Revenue is recognised over time using the input method, based on the costs incurred to
date as a proportion of the total budgeted costs to be incurred for each project.

Revenue (Continued)
a.

Revenue from geotechnical projects (Continued)
Progress billings to the customers are based on a payment schedule in the contract and are typically triggered
upon achievement of specified milestones. A contract asset is recognised when the Group has performed
under the contract but has not yet billed the customer. Conversely, a contract liability is recognised when the
Group has not yet performed under the contract but has received advanced payments from the customer.
Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to consideration become unconditional. Contract
liabilities are recognised as revenue as the Group performs under the contract.
For contract modifications that add distinct goods or services but not at their standalone selling prices, the
Group combines the remaining consideration in the original contract with the consideration promised in the
modification to create a new transaction price that is then allocated to all remaining performance obligations.
For contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services, the Group accounts for the modification
as continuation of the original contract and is recognised as a cumulative adjustment to revenue at the date
of modification.

b.

Sale of Goods
Revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria for acceptance have
been satisfied.
The amount of revenue recognised is based on the estimated transaction price, which comprises the
contractual price, net of the estimated volume discounts and adjusted for expected returns. Based on the
Group’s experience with similar types of contracts, variable consideration is typically constrained and is
included in the transaction only to the extent that it is a highly probable that a significant reversal in the
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable
consideration is subsequently resolved.
The Group recognises the expected volume discounts payable to customer where consideration have been
received from customers and refunds due to expected returns from customers as refund liabilities. Separately,
the Group recognises a related asset for the right to recover the returned goods, based on the former
carrying amount of the good less expected costs to recover the goods, and adjusts them against cost of
sales correspondingly.
At the end of each reporting date, the Group updates its assessment of the estimated transaction price,
including its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. The corresponding
amounts are adjusted against revenue in the period in which the transaction price changes. The Group also
updates its measurement of the asset for the right to recover returned goods for changes in its expectations
about returned goods.

c.

Interest Income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

d.

Rental Income
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis
over the lease terms.

Government Grants
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching
conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred capital
grant on the statement of financial position and is amortised to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the
relevant asset by equal annual instalments.
Where loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions with an interest rate below
the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as additional government grant.

2.24

Income Taxes
a.

Current Income Tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries
where the Group operates and generates taxable income.
Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items
recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management
periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

b.

Deferred Tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:
•

Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability
in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects neither
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible
temporary differences; and

•

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can
be utilised except:
•

Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give
rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences; and

•

In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the
deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting
period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred
tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on
acquisition.

2.25

Contingencies
A contingent liability is:
a.

a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or

b.

a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i)

It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation; or

(ii)

The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except for
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can
be reliably determined.

Share Capital and Share Issuance Expenses
Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.

Non-Current Assets Held for Sale
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly
attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset is
available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is
unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Investment property is not depreciated once classified as held for sale.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent
liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes
that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.
(a)

Judgements made in Applying Accounting Policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
(i)

Taxes
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by
the tax authorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based
on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by
the taxable entity and the relevant tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety
of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective company’s domicile.
Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of
existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or
future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax provisions already recorded.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such
differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination
is made.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting
period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the
financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however,
may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
(i)

Geotechnical contracts
For geotechnical contracts where the Group satisfies its performance obligations over time, management
has determined that a cost-based input method provides a faithful depiction of the Group’s performance in
transferring control of the contracts to the customers, as it reflects the Group’s efforts incurred to date relative
to the total inputs expected to be incurred for the geotechnical contracts. The measure of progress is based
on the costs incurred to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred up to the completion of
the geotechnical contracts.
Significant estimates are required to determine the total budgeted costs and the recoverable variation works
that affect the progress of geotechnical contracts. In making these estimates, management has relied on past
experience and knowledge of the project engineers and quantitative surveyor.
Contract revenue and contract costs recognised for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 are disclosed in
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Contract assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 4
to the financial statements.

(ii)

Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets
The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision
rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.
The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate
the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date,
historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions
and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and forecast
economic conditions. The Group’s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may
also not be representative of a customer’s actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the
Group’s trade receivables and contract assets is disclosed in Note 31(c).
The carrying amount of trade receivables and contract assets is disclosed in Notes 15 and 4 to the financial

(iii)

Impairment of investment in subsidiaries/associates, loan and amounts due from subsidiaries/associates
The Company has applied the applicable accounting guidance in determining whether any impairment on the
carrying value of investment in subsidiaries and associates and loan and amounts due from subsidiaries and
associates as at year-end is required. When indicators of impairment exist, significant estimates is required to
be made by the Company to determine the recoverable amount of the cost of investments. The Company has
to evaluate, among other factors, the growth rates, business forecasts and discount rate for the assessment
of impairment on the investment in subsidiaries and associates.

(iii)

Impairment of investment in subsidiaries/associates, loan and amounts due from subsidiaries/associates
(Continued)
In relation to the assessment of the loss allowance for the loan and amounts due from subsidiaries and
associates, certain assumptions are made, including the future repayment by the subsidiaries and associates,
the business environment and economic outlook and growth rate.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries and amounts due from subsidiaries are
disclosed in Notes 12 and 15 to the financial statements respectively.
The carrying amount of the Company’s investment in associates and amounts due from associates are
disclosed in Notes 13 and 15 to the financial statements respectively.

(iv)

Impairment assessment of patents
Management assesses for indicators of impairment of patents at least on an annual basis. This requires an
estimation of the value-in-use of the patents. The value-in-use calculation is based on a discounted cash
flow model. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow
model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. The
assumptions and estimates used are inherently subjective, and may be affected by uncertainties around future
market or economic conditions.
The carrying amount of the patents is disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.

Unrecognised tax losses and capital allowances
As at 31 March 2025, the Group has unutilised tax losses and capital allowances of approximately S$30,859,000 and
S$838,000 (2024: S$31,402,000 and S$838,000) respectively that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the
companies in which the losses arose, for which no deferred tax asset is recognised due to uncertainty of its recoverability. The
use of these unutilised tax losses and capital allowances is subject to the agreement of the tax authorities and compliance
with certain provisions of the tax legislation. The unutilised tax losses have no expiry date.

EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit/(loss) for the year, net of tax, attributable to owners
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit/(loss) for the year, net of tax, attributable to owners
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year plus the weighted
average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into
ordinary shares.
The following table reflects the loss and share data used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the financial
years ended 31 March:

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES (CONTINUED)
The recoverable amount was determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets
approved by management covering a five-year period. The cash flow projections are based on the long-term growth rate of
Nil% (2024: Nil%) and discount rate of 11.28% (2024: 9.87%).
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
The calculations of value-in-use for the above subsidiaries are most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Forecast revenue and gross margins – Revenue are based on average values achieved in the recent years preceding to the
start of the forecast period. These are increased over the forecast period for anticipated retention of customers, expansion
in business, synergies and efficiency improvements.
Growth rates – Management’s estimates of the forecasted growth rates, with reference to related industry. The forecasted
growth rate adopted by the Company, do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industries relevant to the
subsidiaries.
Discount rates – Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each subsidiary and consider
the time value of money. The computation of discount rate is based on the specific circumstances of the subsidiaries and
derived from its weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost
of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Company. The cost of debt is based on the bank lending
rate as quoted by Monetary Authority of Singapore. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors.
The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regards to the assessment of value-in-use for ADAS Group Pte Ltd, if the discount rate has been 100 basis points
higher, the estimated recoverable amount would still exceed the net carrying value of the investment in ADAS Group Pte Ltd.

Sales of land and factory for the repayment of matured bank loan by TEG
On 14 November 2022, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (the “Bank”) commenced legal action against Tritech
Environmental Group Co., Ltd (“TEG”) in respect of default principal and interest amounting to CNY75.69 million (S$14.50
million). In March 2023, the Bank had transferred the debt to Citic Qingdao Asset Management Co., Ltd. On 3 April 2023,
Qingdao Laoshan People’s Court (the “Court”) delivered its judgement on the case that TEG is liable for the outstanding
principal and interest based on terms and conditions stated in the loan agreement and is to bear the legal costs arising from
the lawsuit. In June 2023, Citic Qingdao Asset Management Co., Ltd had transferred the debt to a third party.
The Court has also instructed TEG to dispose its pledged asset, i.e. the land and factory owned by TEG, within 2 years from
3 April 2023 and use the proceeds to repay the default loan principal and interest and the related legal cost arising from the
lawsuit. TEG is in the process of disposing its land and building in Qingdao. The negotiations are ongoing as at date of the
financial statements.

amounting to 8% of the increased share capital as disclosed in Note 12. As a result of this transaction, a gain on

Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled between 30 to 90 (2024: 30 to 90) days’ terms.
Amounts due to subsidiaries (current)
Amounts due to the subsidiaries mainly comprise rechargeable expenses which are unsecured, non-interest bearing and
repayable on demand in cash.
Other payable
On 12 May 2019, the Group, ADAS Group Pte. Ltd. (“ADAS Group”), and Lim Wen Heng Construction (the “Purchaser”) entered
into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) for the sale of entire shareholding of Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd
(“PE”). One of the components of the sales consideration (“Contingent Consideration”) is the share of 50% of net profits or
net losses after tax, to be generated from PE’s 12 Agreed Projects (“Agreed Projects”) as stipulated in the Agreement from
1 January 2019 to the final completion of all the 12 Agreed Projects (the “Agreed Period”).
The Contingent Consideration met the definition of a financial asset/liability and was accounted for at fair value through profit
or loss at the end of the financial year end. The fair value of the Contingent Consideration was determined by the profits from
the Agreed Projects which were expected to be completed in 2024.
On the date of disposal on 12 May 2019, the fair value of the Contingent Consideration was assessed to be approximately
S$4.0 million and payment of S$4.0 million was received by the Group for the financial year ended 31 March 2020. As at
31 March 2020, the Group re-assessed and determined the fair valuation of the Contingent Consideration to be S$4.0 million.
As at 31 March 2021, the Group was informed by PE that the expected profitability of the Agreed Projects was affected by
the escalation in costs due to COVID-19 implications. As at 31 March 2023, PE stated that the Agreed Projects encountered
unexpected complexities, which resulted in further escalation of costs and also in the extension of the completion timelines
for the projects.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES (CONTINUED)
Other payable (Continued)
In December 2022, the Group and ADAS Group commenced legal action in the General Division of the High Court of the
Republic of Singapore against the Purchaser and certain of its directors (collectively, “Defendants”) for certain declarations and
damages to be assessed by the Court (“Suit”). The Group and ADAS Group’s claim was that they suffered losses and damages
arising out of, amongst other bases, the Purchaser’s breach of the Agreement from its failure to calculate the net profits
or net losses of the Agreed Projects, and consequently the consideration, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
On 22 December 2022, the Group and ADAS Group were served with the Defendants’ Defence and the Purchaser’s
Counterclaim. In the Counterclaim, the Purchaser raised a counterclaim for approximately S$21 million, alleging inter alia that
the costs budgeted to complete the Agreed Projects at the time the Agreement was entered into, were inaccurate, false or
untrue, and an additional counterclaim for S$89,000 for a fine imposed on PE for damages caused to an electricity cable. The
Purchaser also raised an alternative counterclaim for S$5.9 million, this amount being payment of the balance consideration.
On 15 January 2024, the Group, ADAS Group and the Purchaser have come to a full and final settlement of the differences and
claims between the parties by way of a Deed of Settlement. The Group and ADAS Group agree to jointly and severally pay to
the Purchaser the total sum of S$2.5 million. Any amount due between PE, the Purchaser and/or companies related/affiliated to
the Purchaser and the Group and its related/affiliated companies shall be waived and no further payments which may arise
out of or in relation to the Agreement shall be due between the parties. The amount due is recognised as other payable as
at 31 March 2024.

Secured
Mortgage loan from a financial institution, which was denominated in Singapore Dollar, was repayable over 210 months
commencing from 11 May 2012 at the bank’s commercial financing rate. The mortgage loan was secured by the legal mortgage
over the Company’s leasehold property (Note 11). The bank was contractually entitled to request for immediate repayment
of the outstanding loan amount in the event of investment property was classified as asset held for sale, thus the Company
presented the loan as a current liability as at 31 March 2024. On 24 June 2024, the mortgage loan was fully repaid.
Bank overdrafts were secured by the Company’s leasehold property (Note 11) and were denominated in Singapore Dollar.

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Corporate guarantees
The Company and a subsidiary have issued corporate guarantees for bank borrowings and finance lease liabilities of certain
subsidiaries. These bank borrowings and finance lease liabilities amounted to S$1,424,675 (2024: S$2,709,231) at the end
of reporting period and are collateralised against certain assets of the Company and the respective subsidiaries as disclosed
in Notes 23 and 25 to the financial statements respectively. The fair value of such financial guarantees is not expected to
be material due to the credit quality and financial standing of the subsidiaries involved. Accordingly, the financial guarantees
have not been recognised in the financial statements.
Financial support
As at the end of the financial year, the Company had given undertakings to certain subsidiaries to provide continued financial
support to these subsidiaries to enable them to operate as a going concern and to meet their obligations as and when they
fall due for at least 12 months from the date of the authorised financial statements.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services, and has three
reportable segments as follows:
(i)

Smart Urban Development segment, which comprises one-stop integrated service provider for smart urban
development, covering urban planning, site investigation, design and consultancy, engineering survey, instrumentation
and monitoring, project management, construction supervision, data collection, big data analytics, artificial intelligence
and cloud computing digital platform;

(ii)

Water and Environment segment, which comprises one-stop product-technology-design-build-operation service

in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated
financial statements.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

SEGMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
Information about major customers
During the financial year ended 31 March 2025, revenue from 2 (2024: 2) major customers amounted to S$18,090,475
(2024: S$21,638,219) and arose from geotechnical services rendered within the smart urban development business segment.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments.
The key financial risks include interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The board of directors
reviews and agrees policies and procedures for the management of these risks. It is, and has been throughout the years
under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken. The Group and
the Company do not apply hedge accounting.
The following sections provide details regarding the Group’s and the Company’s exposure to the above-mentioned financial
risks and the objectives, policies and processes for the management of these risks.
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures
the risks.
(a)

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company’s financial
instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to
interest rate risk arises primarily from the Group’s short-term deposits, loan from shareholders, finance lease liabilities
and borrowings.
The Group’s policy is to manage interest cost by maintaining an efficient and optimal interest cost structure using a
combination of fixed and variable rate debts, and long and short-term borrowings.
Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk
At the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 100 (2024: 100) basis points higher/lower with all other
variables held constant, the Group’s profit net of tax would have been approximately S$2,100 lower (2024: loss net
of tax S$1,200 lower), arising mainly as a result of higher/lower interest income on cash and short-term deposits and
higher/lower interest expenses on floating rate loans and borrowings.

(b)

Foreign Currency Risk
The Group operates in Asia with dominant operations in Singapore and PRC. Entities in the Group regularly transacts
in currencies other than their respective functional currencies (“foreign currencies”).
Currency risk arises within entities in the Group and the Company mainly from transactions and balances denominated
in New Zealand Dollar (“NZD”). Exposure to foreign currency risk is monitored on an on-going basis to ensure that
the net exposure is at an acceptable level.
As at the end of the reporting period, the carrying amounts of monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies other than the respective entity’s functional currency are disclosed in the respective notes to
the financial statements. The Group and the Company have not entered into any currency forward contracts during
the financial year.

Foreign Currency Risk (Continued)
Sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the NZD and against the functional
currencies of the Group’s entities with all other variables held constant, on the Group’s profit/(loss) before tax:
Group
Increase/(decrease)
Profit/(Loss) before tax
2025

– Strengthened 5% (2024: 5%)
– Weakened 5% (2024: 5%)

134,036
(134,036)

132,118
(132,118)

The potential impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation on profit or loss of the Group as described in the sensitivity
analysis above is attributable mainly to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s exposure on foreign currency
denominated receivables and payables as at the end of the reporting period.
(c)

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its
obligations. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables.
For other financial assets (including investment securities, cash and short-term deposits), the Group and the Company
minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.
The Group’s objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit
risk exposure. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all
customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable
balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.
The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual
payments, within 90 days when they fall due, which are derived based on the Group’s historical information.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(c)

Credit Risk (Continued)
The Group considers “low risk” to be an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency for
those investments with credit rating. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the company
compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of
initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information which
includes the following indicators:
–

Internal credit rating

–

External credit rating

–

Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected
to cause a significant change to the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations

–

Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower

–

Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower

–

Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third-party
guarantees or credit enhancements

–

Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including changes in the
payment status of borrowers in the group and changes in the operating results of the borrower.

The Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when:
–

There is significant difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;

–

There is a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

–

It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

–

There is a disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulty.

The Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-off when a debtor fails to make contractual payments
more than 90 days past due. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such
as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written off,
the company continues to engage enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries
are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.

Credit Risk (Continued)
The following are credit risk management practices and quantitative and qualitative information about amounts arising
from expected credit losses for each class of financial assets.
(i)

Debt instruments and loans at amortised cost
The Group uses three categories of internal credit risk ratings for debt instruments and loans which reflect
their credit risk and how the loss provision is determined for each of those categories. These internal credit
risk ratings are determined through incorporating both qualitative and quantitative information that builds on
information from external credit rating companies, supplemented with information specific to the counterparty
and other external information that could affect the counterparty’s behaviour.
The Group compute expected credit loss for this group of financial assets using the probability of defaults
approach. In calculating the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers implied probability of default
from external rating agencies where available and historical loss rates for each category of counterparty, and
adjusts for forward looking macroeconomic.
A summary of the Group’s internal grading category in the computation of the Group’s expected credit loss
model for the debt instruments is as follows:
Category

provision matrix. The provision rates are determined based on the Group’s historical observed default rates
analysed in accordance to days past due by grouping of customers based on geographical region. The loss
allowance provision as at 31 March 2025 is determined as follows, the expected credit losses below also

Excessive risk concentration
Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities
in the same geographical region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual
obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations
indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Group’s policies and procedures include specific
guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled
and managed accordingly.
Exposure to credit risk
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by:
–

the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position;
and

–

a nominal amount of S$1,424,675 (2024: S$2,709,231) relating to corporate guarantees provided by
the Group to the banks on subsidiaries’ bank loans and certain finance lease liabilities.

Credit risk concentration profile
The Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country and industry sector profile of its
trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The credit risk concentration profile of the Group’s trade receivables
at the end of the reporting period is as follows:

Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired
Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are with debtors with good collection track record
with the Group and the Company. Cash and short-term deposits that are neither past due nor impaired are
placed with reputable commercial banks and financial institutions which are regulated in Singapore and has
no history of default.

(d)

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due
to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of
the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s objective is to maintain a balance
between continuity of funding and by matching the payment and receipt cycle.
The Group and the Company manage their debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and the availability of funding
so as to ensure that all repayment and funding needs are met. As part of the overall prudent liquidity management,
the Group and the Company maintain sufficient levels of cash and short-term deposits to meet their working capital
requirements.
The following table details the Group’s and Company’s remaining contractual maturity for the financial instruments.

FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
(a)

Fair Value Hierarchy
The Group categorises fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs
used as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at
the measurement date;
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly, and
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level
of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Valuation policies and procedures
The Group’s Finance Manager (“FM”) oversees the Group’s financial reporting valuation process and is responsible
for setting and documenting the Group’s valuation policies and procedures.
For all significant financial reporting valuations using valuation model and significant unobservable inputs, it is the
Group’s policy to engage external valuation experts to perform the valuation. The FM is responsible for selecting and
engaging valuation experts that possess the relevant credentials and knowledge on the subject of valuation, valuation
methodologies, and SFRS(I) 13 Fair Value Measurement guidance.
For valuations performed by external valuation experts, the FM reviews the appropriateness of the valuation
methodologies and assumptions adopted. The FM also evaluates the appropriateness and reliability of the inputs
(including those developed internally by the Group) used in the valuations.
In selecting the appropriate valuation models and inputs to be adopted for each valuation that uses significant
unobservable inputs, external valuation experts are requested to calibrate the valuation models and inputs to actual
market transactions (which may include transactions entered into by the Group with third parties as appropriate) that
are relevant to the valuation if such information are reasonably available.
Significant changes in fair value measurements from period to period are evaluated by the FM for reasonableness. Key
drivers of the changes are identified and assessed for reasonableness against relevant information from independent
sources, or internal sources if necessary and appropriate.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Capital includes debt and equity items as disclosed in the table below.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that the Group and the Company are able to continue
as a going concern and maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholders’ value.
Management constantly reviews the capital structure to ensure the Group and the Company are able to service any debt
obligations (include principal repayment and interests) based on their operating cash flows. No changes were made in the
objectives, policies or processes during the financial years ended 31 March 2025 and 2024.
The Group monitors capital based on a gearing ratio. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net
debt is calculated as borrowings, lease liabilities, and trade and other payables, less cash and short-term deposits. Total
capital is calculated as total equity plus net debt.
The Group monitors its capital structure as follows:
