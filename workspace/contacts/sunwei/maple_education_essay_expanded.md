### Introduction

For this report I choose to analyse Maple Education Pte. Ltd. This is a education consultancy company in Singapore that help students apply for overseas universities. I choose this company because I think education industry is very interesting and I know some friends who used this kind of service before. Also, I believe this industry will continue to grow in the future because more and more Asian families want their children to have international education experience.

Singapore has quite a lot of students going abroad to study. According to U.S. Department of Commerce (2024), the number is about 21,666 based on UNESCO data. This means there is good market for education agency. Compared to other countries in the region, Singapore students have high purchasing power and English ability, which makes them attractive market for overseas universities (Mazzarol and Soutar, 2012). In this report I will look at the company's situation using various marketing frameworks and give some suggestions for their marketing strategy going forward.

The report structure will follow standard marketing analysis format. First I will discuss the mission statement. Then I will do external analysis using PESTLE and market analysis. After that I will look at internal marketing audit including the 4Ps and portfolio analysis. Then SWOT analysis will bring together the findings. Finally I will propose marketing objectives and strategies based on the analysis.

### Mission Statement

The company's mission is "To empower students in achieving their global education aspirations through personalised guidance, expert knowledge, and unwavering commitment to their academic success."

I think this mission statement is okay. Kotler, Keller and Chernev (2021) said mission statement should focus on customer need not just the product. This one does talk about helping students achieve their dream which is good. It follows what Drucker (1974) called the purpose of business which is to create customer. By focusing on student aspiration the company show they understand what customer really want.

But to be honest I feel it is a bit generic. Many education agency can say the same thing. McDonald and Wilson (2016) suggest that mission should show what is unique about the company. Aaker (2014) also mentioned that mission should provide strategic direction and differentiation. Maybe Maple Education can add something more specific like their success rate or special service they offer. For example they could say something about their UK university expertise or personal approach.

### External Marketing Audit

#### PESTLE Analysis

Let me start with PESTLE analysis. Wilson and Gilligan (2012) recommend using this framework to understand macro environment. I will discuss the factors that are most relevant to education consultancy business.

For political factor, government policy affect the industry quite a lot. Singapore government support overseas education through scholarship programs like PSC and A*STAR (Public Service Commission, 2024). This create positive environment for the industry. However, visa policy in destination countries can change suddenly. For example, UK changed graduate visa rule before and this worried some students (Home Office, 2023). Education agencies need to keep up with policy changes in different countries.

For economic factor, Singapore is a rich country. World Bank (2024) data shows GDP per capita is USD 90,674 which is very high. Most families can afford to send children overseas if they want. But exchange rate is something to consider. When Singapore dollar weaken against British pound or US dollar, studying abroad become more expensive. Hollensen (2020) mentioned that economic factor directly affect international service business. Interest rate also matter because some families take education loan to fund overseas study.

For social factor, Singapore people really value education. I heard from friends that parents will do anything for children's education. There is even a word "kiasu" in Singapore which means scared to lose out. Hofstede (2011) framework shows Asian cultures tend to have long term orientation which means they willing to invest now for future benefit. Education is seen as investment in Singapore society. So parents want their children to have the best education possible.

U.S. Department of Commerce (2024) report some interesting data. People with overseas degree have 23% higher chance to get job and 41% more likely to get higher salary. This is quite convincing reason for families to invest in overseas education. The return on investment is clear which drive demand.

For technology factor, the industry is changing because of digital. Now students expect to see virtual campus tour and do online consultation. Chaffey and Ellis-Chadwick (2022) said companies must adopt technology or they will be left behind. Rogers (2003) diffusion of innovation theory suggest that early adopters of technology gain competitive advantage. Some big agencies already have AI tool to match students with universities. If Maple Education don't catch up they will lose customers especially younger generation who expect digital service.

For legal factor, there are regulation about education agent. In Australia for example, agents must register with government (Australian Government, 2024). UK also have guidelines for education consultants. Companies need to follow these rules or they cannot operate properly. Data protection is another concern because agencies handle personal information of students and families. They must comply with PDPA in Singapore (PDPC, 2023).

For environmental factor, this is less relevant but still worth mentioning. Climate change make some students think about sustainability of universities. Also, air travel for study abroad contribute to carbon emission. Some universities now offer carbon offset program. This might become more important in future.

#### Market Analysis

Now for market analysis. The global study abroad market is very big. Dataintelo (2024) report says it reached USD 129.5 billion in 2024 and will grow to USD 282.7 billion by 2033. That is about 9% growth every year which is impressive. Asia Pacific is a big part of this market with USD 28.5 billion. China and India are the biggest source countries but Singapore is also significant in proportion to population.

For Singapore specifically, UK is the most popular place to study. Then Australia and USA. UCAS (2024) said Singapore students accepted by UK universities reached record high in 2024. But British Council (2025) report shows application for 2025 dropped a bit, about 4.5%. I'm not sure why but maybe students are looking at other options now like Europe where some countries have free tuition. QAA (2023) report on international student trend suggest that cost become more important factor in decision making.

About market segmentation, I divide into four groups based on demographics and behavior. Kotler and Keller (2021) said effective segmentation should be measurable, substantial, accessible and actionable.

First is undergraduate students, mostly JC or polytechnic graduate around 18 to 20 years old. Their parents pay for them usually. This is the biggest group maybe 45% of market. They need a lot of guidance because first time applying overseas. Parents are the real decision maker even though students are the user.

Second is working adults who want to do masters degree. They are 24 to 35 years old and pay by themselves or company sponsor. Maybe 30% of market. They are more independent and know what they want. Often looking for specific program that help their career. Time is important factor because they are working.

Third is younger students who want to do secondary school abroad, around 15% I think. This segment require more service like guardian arrangement and accommodation. Parents very involved and concerned about safety. Premium price segment because comprehensive service needed.

Last is the rich families who only want top universities like Oxford or Harvard. Money is not a problem for them. Small group maybe 10% but high value. They expect very personal service and consultant with good network. Success rate is most important not price.

For competitor analysis, the biggest one is IDP Education. They are really big with operation in 57 countries. IDP Education (2024) website says they helped 113,000 students in one year and they have 2,200 counsellors. They also own IELTS test which is big advantage because most students need IELTS to apply. Porter (1985) five forces suggest that when competitor have unique resource like IELTS it create barrier for others.

Compare to them Maple Education is very small. But maybe that is also advantage because small company can give more personal service. Big company sometimes feel like factory where you are just a number. Treacy and Wiersema (1993) customer intimacy strategy suggest that some companies can win by being closer to customer rather than competing on scale.

### Internal Marketing Audit

Now let me look at the company's marketing mix which is the 4Ps. McCarthy (1960) originally proposed this framework and it still useful today although some say it should expand to 7Ps for service (Booms and Bitner, 1981).

For product, Maple Education offer quite standard service. They help students choose university, write personal statement, apply for visa, prepare before departure, and find accommodation. The service can be seen as three levels following Kotler model. Core product is getting into university. Actual product is the consultation and application service. Augmented product is the ongoing support and advice.

Nothing very special compare to other agencies to be honest. Maybe they can think about adding some unique service like career planning or alumni network. Levitt (1980) said companies must differentiate or compete on price which is dangerous.

For price, they use two method. If student apply to partner universities, the service is free because company get commission from university. This is common in the industry. But if student want non-partner university or very competitive one like Ivy League, they charge fee around SGD 2,000 to 5,000. This is reasonable compared to market. Nagle and Holden (2002) suggest pricing should reflect value delivered. For Ivy League service the fee is justified because require more expertise and effort.

For place, they have office in Singapore city area. Location is important for education consultancy because parents and students want to visit in person especially for first meeting. They also do online consultation now especially after COVID. Hybrid model is becoming standard. They go to schools to give presentation and attend education fairs which is good way to reach target customer. Rosenbloom (2013) mentioned that multiple channel can increase market coverage.

For promotion, they use social media like Instagram and Facebook mainly. Also do SEO for their website to attract organic search traffic. They have referral program where existing customer get reward for recommending friends. Word of mouth is very important in this industry because parents trust recommendation from other parents (Zeithaml, Bitner and Gremler, 2018).

But I feel their promotion is not very strong compare to big competitors who have more budget for advertising. Fill (2016) said integrated marketing communication important to create consistent message. Maple Education could do better in coordinating their different promotion activities.

#### Product Portfolio Analysis

For product portfolio, I use Boston Matrix to analyse different service lines. Henderson (1979) developed this at Boston Consulting Group.

UK university application is the star because UK is most popular destination and probably still growing. High market share in growing market. Should invest more here to maintain leadership position.

Australian application is cash cow, stable income but market not growing much anymore. Should harvest profit from this to fund other areas. Don't need much new investment.

European application like Germany and Netherlands is question mark. It could be big opportunity because of free tuition but market is uncertain. Need to decide whether to invest heavily or not. Low market share currently but potential for growth.

US Ivy League service is also question mark, need a lot of expertise but could be profitable if done well. Very competitive though. Might consider partnership with US specialist agency.

### SWOT Analysis

McDonald and Wilson (2016) give guideline for SWOT so I follow their approach. They say SWOT should summarise key issues from external and internal analysis.

For strengths, Maple Education is small so they can give personal attention. They won't treat you like just a number. This is valuable in service industry where relationship matter (Berry, 1995). They have good relationship with some UK universities especially Russell Group. Their consultants have overseas study experience themselves so they understand the process from student perspective. Office location is accessible by MRT which is convenient.

For weaknesses, not many people know about them. Brand awareness is low compare to IDP or Kaplan. The team is small so if many students come at same time during peak season they might not cope with demand. They mainly know about UK, not so expert in other countries like Germany or Canada. Their digital marketing could be better, website look a bit outdated.

For opportunities, there is growing interest in European countries like Germany where tuition is free. This could be new market to develop. They can invest in technology to serve more students efficiently without losing personal touch. Can partner with more schools in Singapore to get referral. The salary benefit of overseas education, the 23% and 41% figures, is good selling point they can use more in marketing materials.

For threats, big companies like IDP have more money for marketing and more resources. They might squeeze small players out. Some universities now recruit directly without using agents which reduce role of consultancy. If economy become bad families might not afford overseas education, this is always a risk. Visa policy in UK or other countries might change and affect student numbers like what happened with Brexit initially.

### Marketing Objectives and Strategies

Based on analysis above, I suggest these objectives for Maple Education. Objectives should be SMART as Doran (1981) suggested - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound.

First, increase market share from about 3% to 6% in two years. This is ambitious but achievable if they execute well. Second, grow revenue by 30% by developing postgraduate service for working adults segment which is currently underserved. Third, start offering service for Germany and Netherlands to capture growing demand for European education. Fourth, increase website traffic by 50% through better digital marketing and SEO improvement.

For strategy I use Ansoff Matrix to map the options. Ansoff (1957) identified four growth strategies based on product and market.

Market penetration means getting more customers in current market with existing service. They can do more digital marketing especially on Instagram where young people are. Can give better referral rewards to encourage word of mouth. Can partner with more schools to reach students earlier. This is safest strategy as Ansoff noted because both market and product are familiar.

Market development means finding new customer groups with existing service. Working adults wanting masters degree is good target because they have money and motivated. Can reach them through LinkedIn advertising and company HR departments who sponsor staff education. Geographic expansion to Malaysia could also be considered in future.

Product development means creating new service for existing market. AI matching tool is one idea that can help students find suitable university faster. Online preparation course for IELTS or personal statement writing is another. These can differentiate from competitors and add value.

Diversification means completely new business in new market. Maybe career coaching for students who graduated and came back to Singapore. But this is most risky so should be careful. Porter (2008) mentioned company should choose strategy based on their resources and capabilities. Maple Education is small so should focus on penetration and development first before trying diversification.

### Implementation Considerations

Strategy without implementation is just dream. Bonoma (1984) wrote about this gap between strategy and execution. Here are some key considerations.

For timeline, I suggest phase approach. Year one focus on market penetration and building digital presence. Year two can start market development and product development. This allow company to build capability gradually.

For budget, digital marketing does not need huge investment. Can start with SGD 2,000 per month for social media advertising and see result before scaling up. Technology investment like website upgrade might need SGD 10,000 to 20,000 one time.

For organization, might need to hire one more consultant especially someone with European university knowledge. Also consider part time social media manager or outsource to agency.

For measurement, should track key metrics like website traffic, inquiry conversion rate, student application number, and customer satisfaction score. Review quarterly and adjust strategy if needed.

### Conclusion

To summarise, Maple Education operate in a growing market with good fundamentals. The study abroad market will reach USD 282.7 billion by 2033 according to Dataintelo (2024). Singapore is wealthy country where families value education highly. These macro factors are favorable for the industry.

The company's main strength is personal service which big competitors cannot easily copy. In service industry this customer intimacy can be sustainable advantage (Treacy and Wiersema, 1993). The relationship with UK universities is also valuable resource.

However there are areas need improvement. Brand awareness is low and digital presence is weak. The company rely too much on UK and miss opportunity in other markets.

To be more successful they should invest in digital technology to improve efficiency and reach. They should learn about more countries especially Europe where demand is growing. They should do more marketing to build brand awareness, maybe focus on content marketing which is cost effective. And they should use the employment benefit data in their promotion because the 23% higher job chance and 41% higher salary is very convincing message for parents who are real decision maker.

If they follow these recommendations I believe they can grow their market share from 3% to 6% which is the target. It won't be easy because competition is strong but the opportunity is there for company that can deliver quality service with personal touch.
