Reference [jars] for the exact jar body (middle column, top — the 'Blossoms' blue floral print) and [lids] for the exact blue Pavisha embossed lid (top-right position).\n\nThe visual result I need — describe exactly what the final image looks like:\n\n- The jar floats against a PURE WHITE background — completely white, no shadows on the background, no gray, no gradient, clinical Amazon-style white\n- Both sides of the jar have THIN BRIGHT WHITE LINES running along the edges — like glowing white contour lines that separate the clear plastic from the white background. These bright edge highlights are the signature of premium clear container photography.\n- The jar sits on a surface with a soft, clean REFLECTION visible beneath it — like a mirror that fades to white\n- The blue lid has visible embossed PAVISHA text with small shadows in every letter groove, giving it dimensional depth\n- The blue floral Blossoms artwork is VIVID and ELECTRIC — saturated blues that pop off the screen\n- The PET plastic looks crystal clear — you can see the back-side print faintly through the front wall\n- The overall feel is PREMIUM, COMMERCIAL, TRUSTWORTHY — not artistic, not lifestyle, not rustic. Pure clinical commercial product photography.\n- The image is RAZOR SHARP throughout\n\nThis is the exact style of image you see when you search 'Milton clear container' or 'Lock & Lock storage jar' on Amazon India.",
