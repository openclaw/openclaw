  "prompt": "Professional studio product photograph of a clear PET plastic storage jar. Reference [source] for the EXACT artwork, colors, and design — specifically the jar in the middle column, top position (the one with the blue screw lid and 'Blossoms' cursive floral print).\n\nThis is a single straight-sided cylindrical PET jar, approximately 500ml, 12cm tall, 8cm diameter. Wide mouth with a solid blue opaque plastic screw-on lid. The body is clear transparent PET with a single continuous printed artwork wrap: blue lily flowers, green leaves, cursive 'Blossoms' text, blue wave motifs, and blue diamond/geometric accents.\n\nThe clear PET plastic is a SELLING POINT — the transparency demonstrates quality. Light must transmit through the body, revealing internal clarity. You should see faint artwork from the back side through the front wall (characteristic of clear PET jars). The surface has a subtle glossy sheen but NO harsh speculars or hot spots.\n\nStudio photography setup: Three-point lighting with soft diffused key light from upper-left at 45 degrees casting gentle modelling shadows to define the cylinder. Fill light from right to prevent harsh shadows. Subtle rim/backlight to define the cylindrical edges, enhance the PET transparency, and create a thin bright outline separating the product from the background. Light gray (#F5F5F5) gradient background — NOT pure white — because the clear plastic edges would disappear against pure white. Soft natural contact shadow beneath for grounding and weight.\n\nEye-level camera with very slight elevation (5-10 degrees). Product fills 75% of frame, centered, with even margins. Deep focus — everything tack sharp from front label through lid to back wall. All printed text must be crisp and legible at 200% zoom.\n\nThis must look like it came from a professional product photography studio. The kind of shot you'd see on Amazon or Flipkart for a premium kitchenware brand.",
