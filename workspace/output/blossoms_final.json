  "prompt": "Create a PREMIUM e-commerce hero image of a clear PET storage jar. This is a product photograph that must compete with Lock & Lock, Milton, and Borosil on Amazon India.\n\nREFERENCE IMAGES:\n- [lids] shows the ACTUAL blue Pavisha lid (top-right in 2x2 grid) with embossed PAVISHA text and nature relief pattern\n- [jars] shows the ACTUAL jar body (middle column, top position) — clear PET with blue 'Blossoms' floral print\n\nTHE PRODUCT:\nA straight-sided cylindrical clear PET storage jar (~500ml, ~12cm tall, 8cm wide) with:\n- BODY: Crystal clear transparent PET with a single continuous printed wrap — blue lily flowers, green leaves, cursive 'Blossoms' text, blue wave motifs, blue diamond geometric accents. Match [jars] artwork EXACTLY.\n- LID: Solid blue opaque plastic screw-on cap with embossed 'PAVISHA' text and embossed floral/nature relief pattern on top surface. Match [lids] EXACTLY.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY BRIEF (shoot this like a ₹50,000 commercial product shoot):\n\nLIGHTING — This is the most critical element:\n- KEY LIGHT: Large softbox from upper-left at 45°, soft diffused\n- FILL LIGHT: Softer fill from right to prevent harsh shadows\n- RIM/BACK LIGHT: TWO strip lights at 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions behind the jar. These must create DRAMATIC BRIGHT WHITE GLOWING EDGE HIGHLIGHTS tracing the entire cylindrical contour of the jar on BOTH sides. This rim glow is THE signature look of premium clear container photography — it makes the PET edges look like they're lit from within. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n- LID ACCENT: Small overhead spot raking across the lid at ~15° angle to create STRONG directional micro-shadows in every groove of the embossed PAVISHA text and relief pattern. The embossing must POP with visible depth.\n- All lights at 5500K neutral daylight\n\nBACKGROUND & SURFACE:\n- Pure white background blown out to #FFFFFF — Amazon compliant, no grey, no gradient\n- Jar sits on a HIGH-GLOSS BLACK ACRYLIC surface that creates a CRISP, MIRROR-SHARP reflection of the jar base. The reflection should fade gradually downward — sharp at the contact point, soft at the bottom. This reflection is a premium quality signal.\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- Product fills 70-75% of frame\n- Slight 3/4 rotation (8-10° off center) for dimension — shows front label AND lid top\n- Slight elevation (5-8°) so lid embossing is partially visible\n- Centered with even margins\n\nMATERIAL RENDERING:\n- PET BODY: The transparency must SHINE. Rim light transmitting through the clear PET walls is the hero moment — the edges should glow bright white/blue. Back-side artwork should be faintly visible through the front wall (reversed). The PET should look crystal clear, premium quality, not cheap or cloudy. Subtle specular highlights following the cylindrical form.\n- LID: Opaque blue plastic with the embossed relief DRAMATICALLY visible through the raking overhead spot. Every letter of PAVISHA should cast a tiny shadow. The surface should have a subtle form-following highlight.\n\nCOLOR & POST-PRODUCTION:\n- Colors ELECTRIC — blues should vibrate on screen. Push saturation +15-20% on blues and greens.\n- Contrast: High S-curve for depth and punch\n- Sharpness: Razor tack sharp — every text character, every flower petal, every embossed groove crisp at 200% zoom\n- The final image should STOP someone mid-scroll on Amazon",
