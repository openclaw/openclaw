  "prompt": "Good extraction. Now look at [lids] — it shows 4 Pavisha-branded lids. The BLUE lid in the top-right position is the ACTUAL lid for this jar. It has embossed 'PAVISHA' text and an embossed decorative nature/floral relief pattern on its top surface.\n\nReplace the current lid on the jar with this ACTUAL Pavisha embossed lid from [lids]. The lid should sit naturally on the jar — same diameter, screwed on properly.\n\nAlso enhance the photography:\n- Add studio three-point lighting: soft key from upper-left, fill from right, STRONG rim/backlight from behind to create dramatic bright edge outlines along both sides of the jar and transmit light through the PET body\n- The rim light should make the jar edges GLOW — this is the money shot for clear PET\n- Light gray gradient background (#F0F0F0 to #E0E0E0) with a subtle reflective surface beneath showing a soft faded reflection of the jar base\n- Soft contact shadow for grounding\n- The lid's embossed PAVISHA pattern should be revealed through directional micro-shadows\n- Slight 3/4 rotation (10-15°) so we see both the front label AND the lid top surface\n- Make the PET transparency the star — light passing through, back-side artwork visible, internal clarity\n- Tack sharp everything\n\nKeep the REAL jar body from the previous turn — only replace the lid and enhance the lighting/background. Do NOT regenerate the jar artwork.",
