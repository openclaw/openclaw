Use [source] as the REFERENCE for the exact artwork, colors, and design — specifically look at the TOP JAR in the MIDDLE COLUMN (it has a blue lid and blue floral 'Blossoms' print).\n\nThe jar is:\n- A single straight-sided CYLINDER shape (not tapered, not hourglass, not pinched — a simple uniform-width cylinder)\n- Clear transparent PET plastic body\n- Wide mouth opening with a solid BLUE opaque plastic screw-on lid\n- ONE continuous printed artwork wrap covering the body: blue lily flowers, green leaves, blue wave pattern, and the cursive word 'Blossoms' — exactly matching [source]\n- Approximately 500ml capacity, roughly 12cm tall x 8cm diameter\n\nPhotography setup:\n- Pure white background\n- Studio three-point lighting: soft key light from upper-left, fill from right, subtle backlight to define the cylindrical edges and show PET transparency\n- Light passes through the clear PET body showing its quality and clarity\n- Eye-level camera angle, very slight elevation (5-10 degrees)\n- Soft contact shadow beneath the jar for grounding\n- Product fills 75% of frame, centered\n- Tack sharp focus throughout — all printed text must be legible",
