The BLUE lid is in the top-right position — it has embossed 'PAVISHA' text and an embossed decorative nature/floral pattern on its inner surface. This is the ACTUAL cap for this product.\n\n[jars] shows PET storage jars stacked in columns. The Blossoms jar (blue floral print, cursive 'Blossoms' text, blue lily flowers, green leaves, wave motifs) is the jar body.\n\nCOMPOSE these two components into ONE complete product shot: the clear PET Blossoms jar body WITH the actual blue Pavisha embossed lid from [lids] screwed on top.\n\nThe COMPLETE product is:\n- A straight-sided cylindrical clear PET jar, ~500ml, ~12cm tall, ~8cm diameter\n- Body: clear transparent PET with printed blue floral 'Blossoms' artwork (single continuous wrap)\n- Lid: the ACTUAL blue opaque plastic screw-on cap from [lids] — with embossed PAVISHA text and embossed floral/nature relief pattern on top surface. The lid has a raised rim edge and the embossed pattern is visible through light-and-shadow interplay on the opaque plastic surface.\n\nPhotography setup:\n- Light gray gradient background (#F2F2F2 to #E5E5E5) — NOT pure white, clear PET edges vanish against white\n- Studio three-point lighting: soft diffused key light upper-left at 45°, fill from right, STRONG rim/backlight from behind to define cylindrical edges and dramatically enhance PET transparency\n- The rim light should create a clear bright outline along both sides of the jar, separating it from the background\n- Backlight transmits through clear PET body showing internal clarity and quality\n- The lid's embossed PAVISHA text and pattern should be revealed through directional lighting casting micro-shadows in the relief\n- Soft contact shadow + subtle surface reflection beneath for grounding\n- Eye-level camera, very slight 5-10° elevation and slight 10-15° rotation (3/4 view) to show both the front label AND the lid's embossed top surface\n- Product fills 75% of 1:1 frame, centered\n- Deep focus — everything tack sharp\n- 5500K neutral color temperature\n\nThis must look like premium Amazon/Flipkart hero photography — the kind that makes someone click 'Add to Cart'.",
