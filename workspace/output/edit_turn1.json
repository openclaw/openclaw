I need you to extract ONLY the jar at the TOP of the MIDDLE column — the one with the blue screw lid and blue floral 'Blossoms' print.\n\nExtract it cleanly from the stacked arrangement. Remove the other jars, remove the background wall, remove everything except this one jar. Give it a transparent/clean background. Preserve EVERY detail of the actual product — the exact print, exact colors, exact shape, exact lid. Do not regenerate or reinterpret anything — this is a real product photo and I need the real product, just isolated.",
