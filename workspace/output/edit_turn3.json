  "prompt": "The product looks real and authentic — that's great. But the LIGHTING is killing it. It looks like a passport photo. I need this to look like premium e-commerce photography.\n\nDo these changes while keeping the same real product:\n\n1. PURE WHITE BACKGROUND — switch from gray to #FFFFFF. Amazon-standard pure white.\n\n2. ADD DRAMATIC RIM/BACKLIGHT — This is the #1 priority. Place a strong strip light directly behind the jar. I need BRIGHT GLOWING EDGES running along both sides of the jar cylinder. This is how you sell clear PET — the edges should GLOW with transmitted light. Think of how Milton, Borosil, Cello light their clear containers on Amazon.\n\n3. LIGHT THE LID — Add a small overhead spot that rakes across the lid surface at a low angle, creating STRONG micro-shadows in the embossed PAVISHA text and relief pattern. The embossing should POP with dramatic shadow contrast.\n\n4. REFLECTIVE SURFACE — Place the jar on a high-gloss reflective surface (black or white acrylic). The reflection should be CRISP and mirror-sharp with a controlled gradient fade — not ghostly and faint like before.\n\n5. BOOST COLOR VIBRANCY — Increase saturation 10-15%. The blues should be ELECTRIC. The green leaves should be vivid. Make it pop.\n\n6. ADD SLIGHT ANGLE — Rotate the jar 5-10° off dead center for dimension and visual energy.\n\n7. SHARPEN — Tack sharp everything. Labels at 200% zoom must be legible.\n\nThe goal: Transform this from a ₹500 tabletop shoot into a ₹5000 studio shoot. Same REAL product, DRAMATICALLY better photography. When someone scrolls past this on Amazon, they should STOP.",
