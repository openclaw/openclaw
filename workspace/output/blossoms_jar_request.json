  "prompt": "Professional product photography: extract the MEDIUM-sized clear PET jar with blue 'Blossoms' floral print and BLUE screw-on lid from [source]. It's in the middle column, top position of the 3-column stacked arrangement. Create a clean catalog hero shot on pure white background. The jar is clear transparent PET plastic with printed blue flower artwork featuring the word 'Blossoms' in cursive, blue wave patterns, green leaves, and large blue lily flowers. The lid is a solid blue opaque plastic screw cap. Studio three-point lighting: soft key light from upper-left to reveal the transparency of the PET and the printed artwork, fill from right for even illumination, subtle backlight to define the jar's cylindrical edges and show the clear plastic quality. Soft contact shadow beneath. Camera angle: eye-level to slight elevation (10-15 degrees) to show the full label artwork and lid. Product fills 75-80% of frame, centered. The clear PET material should show its transparency and quality — light should pass through the jar showing internal clarity.",
