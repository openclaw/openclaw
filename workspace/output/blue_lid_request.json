  "prompt": "Professional product photography: extract the blue round plastic lid from [source] (top-right position in the 2x2 grid). Create a clean catalog hero shot on pure white background. The lid has embossed 'PAVISHA' branding and decorative nature/floral pattern embossed into the inner surface. Preserve the EXACT blue color — do not shift or saturate. The surface is glossy opaque plastic with a raised rim edge. Studio three-point lighting: soft key light from upper-left, fill from right, subtle backlight for rim definition. Soft contact shadow beneath to ground the product. Camera angle: very slight top-down (10-15 degrees) to show the embossed inner pattern while maintaining the circular shape. Product fills 75-80% of frame, centered.",
