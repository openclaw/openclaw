## Late Night Discussion: Agent Architecture for Pavisha/AutifyME

Abhishek and I discussed the multi-agent setup in depth. Key decisions/insights:

### Different Identities per Agent ✅ CONFIRMED
- Abhishek wants each specialist agent to have its OWN personality, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md
- This is how they become true specialists — not just skill differences but personality differences
- Example: Sales agent is confident/persuasive, Inventory agent is precise/cautious

### Shared Workspace Strategy
- Discussed two options: shared workspace vs separate workspaces with symlinked skills
- Leaning toward shared workspace (Option A) since agents need to see same data (products, orders, customers)
- Specialization comes from SOUL.md personality + allowed skills, not data isolation

### OpenClaw Multi-Agent Config Structure
- `agents.list` defines each agent with id, name, workspace
- `bindings` routes inbound messages to specific agents based on channel/peer
- Each agent gets its own session store (separate conversation history)

### Personal Agents for Family Members ✅ CONFIRMED WANT
- Abhishek wants to give his mom her own agent — she defines the identity/soul
- Her WhatsApp number gets bound to her agent via `bindings`
- Completely separate from Jarvis — separate sessions, separate personality
- She can't see Abhishek's conversations, he can't see hers

### Customer-Facing Agent ✅ CONFIRMED WANT
- Customers messaging Pavisha should get a customer rep agent automatically
- Two approaches discussed:
  1. **Default agent routing** — unknown numbers → rep agent, Abhishek's number → Jarvis
  2. **Separate WhatsApp Business number** — business number → rep, personal → Jarvis (preferred at scale)
- Rep agent capabilities: product queries, catalog/pricing from DB, image sharing, order taking, escalation to Abhishek
- `dmPolicy: "open"` needed to accept messages from anyone
- This ties into existing priority: "Connect Pavisha WhatsApp Business number to OpenClaw"

### Architecture Summary
```
OpenClaw Instance
├── Jarvis (main) ← Abhishek's personal number
├── Mom's Agent ← Mom's number (her own SOUL.md)
├── Pavisha Rep ← Business number / default for unknown numbers
├── Sales Specialist ← spawned by Jarvis or direct binding
├── Inventory Agent ← spawned by Jarvis
└── Catalog Agent ← spawned by Jarvis (image-gen + database skills)
```

### Still To Discuss
- How domain routing works (Jarvis as router vs direct bindings)
- Which agent to build first
- Mom's agent details
- Customer rep personality and capabilities
- Security/permissions per agent
