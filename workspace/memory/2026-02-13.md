# 2026-02-13

## OpenClaw Update: v2026.2.10 → v2026.2.13
- Fetched upstream, fast-forwarded main (234 commits, 594 files changed)
- `pnpm install` + `pnpm build` successful
- Rebased `feat/workspace-setup` branch onto updated main
- Stashed workspace files before update, restored after
- Enabled `commands.restart: true` in config (was missing)
- Gateway restarted on new build

### Update Process Notes
- Updater (`update.run`) requires clean git working tree — workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily notes, AutifyME submodule) cause "dirty" skip
- Workaround: `git stash` → checkout main → pull upstream → rebase feature branch → stash pop
- AutifyME submodule always shows as dirty (untracked content inside) — can't fully clean without removing files

## Pending (carried from 2026-02-12)
- [ ] BIOS check: Deep Sleep + ErP Ready → Disabled (auto-power-on after outage)
- [ ] Schema migration: deploy AutifyME v2 to single Supabase project
- [ ] User role system design
- [ ] Connect Pavisha WhatsApp Business number to OpenClaw
