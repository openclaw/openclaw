## Decisions
- **Backend DB:** Supabase or local Postgres only. No Tally integration for now — deferred.
- **Memory system:** Keep it simple. MEMORY.md (small cheat sheet) + daily files (detailed). No topic files, no fancy structure. Just write more, write often, write immediately.
- **AutifyME pivot** continues (see MEMORY.md)

## PC Auto-Start Setup
- **Motherboard:** ASRock B450 Steel Legend
- **Issue:** BIOS "Restore on AC Power Loss → Power On" not working after power cuts
- **Disabled Windows Fast Startup:** `powercfg /h off` + `reg add HKLM\...\Power /v HiberbootEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
- **Still not working after restart** — likely BIOS settings need changing:
  - Advanced → ACPI Configuration → **Deep Sleep → Disabled**
  - Advanced → ACPI Configuration → **ErP Ready → Disabled**
- **Status:** Abhishek needs to check BIOS manually. Pending.

## OpenClaw Auto-Start
- Was running manually via `pnpm run openclaw gateway` from `D:\openclaw`
- Tried Windows Scheduled Task — failed (needs admin elevation)
- **Solution:** Added startup bat file:
  - Path: `C:\Users\autif\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\openclaw-gateway.bat`
  - Content: `cd /d D:\openclaw && start "" "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" scripts/run-node.mjs gateway`
- Now OpenClaw starts automatically on Windows login

## Workspace Migration
- **Moved workspace** from `C:\Users\autif\.openclaw\workspace` → `D:\openclaw\workspace`
- Updated config via `gateway config.patch`: `agents.defaults.workspace = "D:\\openclaw\\workspace"`
- Deleted old workspace at `C:\Users\autif\.openclaw\workspace`
- **Reason:** Keep all OpenClaw files together on D: drive
- AutifyME repo path updated: `D:\openclaw\workspace\AutifyME`

## D: Drive Contents
- `D:\openclaw` — OpenClaw source + workspace
- `D:\.pnpm-store` — pnpm package cache
- `D:\tmp` — temp folder

## Identity
- Updated IDENTITY.md: I'm Jarvis, Abhishek is Tony Stark
- Updated SOUL.md vibe section to match
- We're partners building things normal people can't imagine

## Memory System Overhaul
- Trimmed MEMORY.md from ~2KB to ~1.1KB — removed historical details, kept only essentials
- Removed: TallyPrime setup details, GST registration specifics, online presence details, AutifyME architecture details
- **Rule:** MEMORY.md = cheat sheet (what I need EVERY conversation). Daily files = details (searchable).
- Updated AGENTS.md with "Daily File Discipline" section — write continuously, not just at compaction
- Discussed fancy alternatives (git commits as memory, project STATUS.md, LAST_SESSION.md) — decided against. Simple wins.

## WhatsApp Gateway
- Multiple disconnects overnight (499, 503, 428, 408) — all auto-reconnected
- Connected again at 20:15 after PC restart

## Pending
- [ ] Abhishek to check BIOS: Deep Sleep + ErP Ready → Disabled
- [ ] Start building Supabase/Postgres DB tooling
- [ ] Test auto-start bat on next reboot
