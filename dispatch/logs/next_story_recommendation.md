# Next Story Recommendation

Recommended next P0 story: `STORY-06`.

Rationale:
- `STORY-05` completed server-side role/tool/state authorization hardening and bridge/API policy synchronization.
- The highest remaining P0 dependency for fail-closed closeout behavior is evidence template policy modeling.
- Completing `STORY-06` next unblocks strict evidence gating (`STORY-07`) and policy-violation E2E proof (`STORY-08`).
