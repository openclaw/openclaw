- Core plan: `real-dispatch-agile-package/03-Delivery/01-Sprint-Plan.md`

## Next active story is

`E12-F1-S1`

## Recommended sequence

`E1` -> `E2` -> `E3` -> `E4` -> `E5` -> `E6` -> `E7` -> `E11` -> `E12`.

## Immediate action now

1. Confirm `E12-F1-S1` acceptance criteria are testable and evidence requirements are deterministic.
2. Confirm owner role availability (`Product Architect`, `Automation Lead`) and escalation policy boundaries are in place.
3. Implement/verify one negative-path escalation trigger when ambiguity or high-risk evidence gaps require manual handoff.
4. After `E12-F1-S1` completes, confirm `E7-F2-S1` acceptance criteria (operator override, autonomy pause, rollback, and evidence replay retention) are testable.
5. Execute required acceptance checks before opening PR handoff for closeout readiness.
