# Next Story Recommendation

Canonical backlog source:

- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

## Readiness Note

The backlog is in v0 completion mode and now includes an execution-ready pack for the engineering team.

- Readiness pack: `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/docs/13_V0_Engineering_Readiness_Bundle.md`
- Core plan: `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/docs/12_Sprint_Plan.md`

## Next active story is

`V0-BOOTSTRAP`

## Recommended sequence

`V0-BOOTSTRAP` -> `V0-WORKER-LAUNCH` -> `GLZ-01` -> `GLZ-02` -> `GLZ-03` -> `V0-E2E-LOCK` -> `GLZ-04` -> `GLZ-05` -> `GLZ-06`.

## Immediate action now

1. Confirm `V0-BOOTSTRAP` passes DoR gates in the readiness bundle.
2. Execute bootstrap and capture deterministic outputs as evidence.
3. Only begin `V0-WORKER-LAUNCH` once V0-1 gate readiness is green.
