# Next Story Recommendation

Recommended next P0 story: `STORY-05`.

Rationale:
- `STORY-04` closed the bridge-layer allowlist and request/correlation propagation gap.
- Remaining EPIC-03 risk is authoritative server-side authorization depth and policy synchronization between bridge and dispatch-api.
- Completing `STORY-05` next reduces policy drift risk before moving into evidence enforcement and canonical E2E proof.
