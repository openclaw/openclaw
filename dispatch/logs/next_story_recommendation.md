# Next Story Recommendation

Canonical backlog source:
- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

Recommended immediate start:
1. `MVP-06` durable observability and runbook readiness.

Then:
1. `MVP-07` dispatcher cockpit and technician packet implementation.

Then execute remaining work in rank/dependency order from the canonical backlog.
