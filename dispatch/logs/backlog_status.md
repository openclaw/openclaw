# Backlog Status

Canonical backlog source:

- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

Backlog hygiene rules:

- Keep active backlog items only in the canonical CSV above.
- Do not duplicate backlog rows in this log.
- Completed story history remains in `dispatch/logs/progress_log.md`.

Current active item:

- None. The canonical backlog is currently empty.
- Last completed work: `MVP-08` (Pilot UAT and cutover readiness), with readiness gates signed off in the progress log.
