# Backlog Status

Canonical backlog source:
- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

Backlog hygiene rules:
- Keep active backlog items only in the canonical CSV above.
- Do not duplicate backlog rows in this log.
- Completed story history remains in `dispatch/logs/progress_log.md`.

Current active item:
- `MVP-06` (Operability)
