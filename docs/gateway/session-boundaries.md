Session Steward protects session identity, ownership, delegation, approval,
redaction, and telemetry boundaries. It treats `sessionKey` values as
routing/context selectors, not as bearer credentials or per-user authorization
tokens.

The recommended operator model is still one trusted Gateway boundary per user,
team, or host. If you need real separation between mutually untrusted users,
run separate Gateways with separate credentials, and preferably separate OS
users or hosts. Session boundaries reduce accidental cross-agent routing and
unsafe diagnostic disclosure inside one Gateway; they do not turn one shared
Gateway into hostile multi-tenant isolation.

## Boundary kinds

Session Steward classifies session selectors before Gateway methods use them.
Boundary decisions expose only normalized ownership and redacted session facts.

| Session selector shape | Boundary kind | Behavior                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agent:<agentId>:...`  | `agent`       | Scoped to the normalized owner agent. Decisions report `agent:<agentId>:REDACTED`.                                                         |
| `global`               | `global`      | Gateway-global context. Allowed with an explicit `agentId` when the method supports it.                                                    |
| non-agent legacy keys  | `unscoped`    | Legacy or channel-specific selector with no agent owner encoded in the key. Existing store-owner resolution still applies where supported. |
| missing or blank key   | `unknown`     | No trusted owner can be inferred. Methods either resolve a default context or reject according to their existing contract.                 |
| malformed agent key    | `malformed`   | Invalid `agent:*` selector. Gateway methods that enforce Session Steward boundaries reject it as `INVALID_REQUEST`.                        |

## Agent relation decisions

For `agent:<agentId>:...` selectors, Session Steward compares the owner agent in
the selector with the requested agent, when a requested agent is present.

| Relation      | Meaning                                                          | Gateway result                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `same_agent`  | The session owner and requested agent match after normalization. | The request proceeds.                                               |
| `cross_agent` | The session owner and requested agent differ.                    | Enforced Gateway surfaces reject the request as `INVALID_REQUEST`.  |
| `unbound`     | No comparable owner or requested agent exists.                   | The method follows its normal defaulting or legacy resolution path. |

This means a request that combines a session owned by one agent with a different
explicit `agentId` fails before the handler mutates state or invokes a tool.
The error details include redacted boundary facts, not the raw selector.

## Gateway surfaces currently enforced

Session Steward enforcement currently covers these Gateway surfaces:

- `tools.effective`
- `tools.invoke`
- `sessions.files.list`
- `sessions.files.get`
- `sessions.create`
- `sessions.abort`
- `sessions.usage`
- `sessions.reset`

The policy is intentionally strict for malformed `agent:*` selectors and
cross-agent mismatches. It is intentionally compatible for `global` selectors
with explicit `agentId` and for supported legacy unscoped selectors.

## Redaction contract

Session Steward decisions and diagnostics must not include raw high-cardinality
or sensitive values. The allowed session fact is the normalized owner agent plus
a redacted affected-session value such as `agent:<agentId>:REDACTED`.

Never emit these raw values in Session Steward decisions, errors, logs,
diagnostic attributes, or metrics:

- session tails
- peer IDs
- thread IDs
- request bodies
- tokens
- cookies
- passwords
- API keys
- private keys
- credential material

This redaction contract is why Session Steward returns `UNKNOWN`, `UNSCOPED`,
`GLOBAL`, or `agent:<agentId>:REDACTED` instead of echoing caller-provided
session selectors.

## Diagnostics

Gateway Session Steward checks emit trusted diagnostic events with redacted
metadata only:

- `session_steward.boundary_decision`
- `session_steward.boundary_rejected`

Event attributes may include the Gateway surface, action, outcome, boundary
kind, agent relation, owner agent, requested agent, and redacted affected
session. They must not include the raw `sessionKey`, request body, peer IDs,
thread IDs, or credential-like values.

OpenTelemetry and Prometheus exporters apply their own low-cardinality and
redaction rules on top of these diagnostics. See
[OpenTelemetry privacy and content capture](/gateway/opentelemetry#privacy-and-content-capture)
and [Prometheus label policy](/gateway/prometheus#label-policy).

## Browser Steward compatibility

The combined Browser / Session / Credential Steward remains active for browser
runtime compatibility. Browser-side checks use exact owner classification and
redacted session metadata for Browser Steward decisions. Credential-side checks
classify credential-like request data, block raw credential exposure before
approval, and keep Browser Steward diagnostics limited to redacted credential
classes and reason codes.

Credential Steward redaction policy does not resolve credentials, migrate auth
profiles, or change credential storage. It is a safety boundary for deciding
whether credential material may be handled or reported.

## Troubleshooting

If a Gateway call returns `INVALID_REQUEST` with `session key agent does not
match agentId`, check the caller is not mixing an `agent:<agentId>:...` selector
owned by one agent with another explicit `agentId`.

If a Gateway call returns `INVALID_REQUEST` with `malformed session boundary`,
check that any agent-scoped selector has a non-empty owner segment. The valid
shapes are `agent:<agentId>` or `agent:<agentId>:<session-scope>`. Empty owners
and trailing empty session scopes, such as `agent::...` or `agent:<agentId>:`,
are malformed.

If diagnostics appear to contain raw session material, treat that as a redaction
bug. Capture the diagnostic event type and surface, but do not paste secrets,
session tails, peer IDs, thread IDs, cookies, tokens, passwords, API keys, or
private keys into an issue or support thread.
