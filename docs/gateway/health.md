Short guide to verify Gateway and channel health without guessing. It covers the
CLI health checks, the HTTP probe endpoints, the dedicated `health` command, and
uptime monitoring.

## Quick checks

- `openclaw status` - local summary: gateway reachability/mode, update hint, linked channel auth age, sessions + recent activity.
- `openclaw status --all` - full local diagnosis (read-only, color, safe to paste for debugging).
- `openclaw status --deep` - asks the running gateway for a live probe (`health` with `probe:true`), including per-account channel probes when supported.
- `openclaw status --usage` - show model provider usage/quota snapshots.
- `openclaw health` - asks the running gateway for its health snapshot (WS-only; no direct channel sockets from the CLI).
- `openclaw health --verbose` (alias `--debug`) - forces a live health probe and prints gateway connection details.
- `openclaw health --json` - machine-readable health snapshot output.
- Send `/status` as a standalone chat command in any channel to get a status reply without invoking the agent.
- Logs: run `openclaw logs --follow` (or `openclaw --profile <profile> logs --follow`) and filter for `web-heartbeat`, `web-reconnect`, `web-auto-reply`, `web-inbound`.

For Discord and other chat providers, session rows are not socket liveness.
`openclaw sessions`, Gateway `sessions.list`, and the agent `sessions_list` tool
read stored conversation state. A provider can reconnect and show healthy channel
status before any new session row is materialized. Use the channel status and
health commands above for live connectivity checks.

Per-agent session counts and recent activity include only that agent's sessions,
even when agents share a SQLite session store. Status counts each physical store
once in its aggregate. The top-level health session summary represents the
default agent, or the first configured agent when there is no default; it is not
a fleet total.

## Deep diagnostics

- Creds on disk: `ls -l ~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json` (mtime should be recent).
- Session store: `ls -l ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite`. Count and recent recipients are surfaced via `status`.
- Relink flow: `openclaw channels logout && openclaw channels login --verbose` when status codes 409-515 or `loggedOut` appear in logs. The QR login flow auto-restarts once for status 515 after pairing.
- Diagnostics are enabled by default (`diagnostics.enabled: false` disables them). Memory events record RSS/heap byte counts and threshold/growth pressure. Liveness warnings record event-loop delay/utilization, CPU-core ratio, and active/waiting/queued session counts when the process is running but saturated. Oversized-payload events record what was rejected/truncated/chunked plus sizes and limits, never message text, attachment contents, webhook bodies, raw request/response bodies, tokens, cookies, or secret values.
- The same heartbeat drives the bounded stability recorder: `openclaw gateway stability` (or the `diagnostics.stability` Gateway RPC). Fatal Gateway exits, shutdown timeouts, and restart startup failures persist the latest snapshot under `~/.openclaw/logs/stability/`. Inspect the newest bundle with `openclaw gateway stability --bundle latest`.
- For bug reports, run `openclaw gateway diagnostics export` and attach the generated zip: a Markdown summary, the newest stability bundle, sanitized log metadata, sanitized Gateway status/health snapshots, and config shape. Chat text, webhook bodies, tool outputs, credentials, cookies, account/message identifiers, and secret values are omitted or redacted. See [Diagnostics Export](/gateway/diagnostics).

## Health monitor config

- `channels.<provider>.healthMonitor.enabled`: disable health-monitor restarts for a specific channel while leaving global monitoring enabled.
- `channels.<provider>.accounts.<accountId>.healthMonitor.enabled`: multi-account override that wins over the channel-level setting.
- These per-channel overrides apply to the channels that expose them today: Discord, Google Chat, iMessage, IRC, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp.
- A crashing channel is recovered by its own auto-restart backoff first (`auto-restart attempt N/10` in the logs). The health monitor stays out of the way until that ladder ends with `giving up after 10 restart attempts`, then takes over as the last restart owner.

## Inbound ingress health

Channel connectivity and inbound admission are separate failure domains. A channel can hold a healthy transport connection — sending replies normally — while its durable ingress queue is unavailable, so not a single inbound message is admitted.

- When a channel cannot open its durable ingress queue, its start fails and the gateway records the account as unable to receive. `openclaw channels status` reports `Channel cannot admit inbound events; its durable ingress queue is unavailable. Outbound may still work.`
- Such an account is **unhealthy** regardless of transport state, and readiness reports it as failing. Previously it reported `health: healthy` and the health monitor never touched it.
- Recovery stays automatic. The ingress verdict describes the account's last start attempt and is cleared by the next one, so the ordinary restart path is also how a transient queue-open failure recovers. Those restarts log as `health-monitor: restarting (reason: ingress-unavailable)` instead of the generic `stuck`.
- If the restarts keep repeating, the cause is not transient. Check the logged ingress failure: a plugin denied the `openChannelIngressQueue` capability, for example, needs operator action rather than another restart.
- Channels that never report ingress state are unaffected: absence means "no signal", never "broken". There is no traffic-staleness heuristic, so a genuinely quiet channel is never marked unhealthy for having received nothing.

## HTTP probes

The Gateway exposes three unauthenticated `GET`/`HEAD` probe pairs:

| Endpoints               | Meaning                                                                                                       | Use                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/health`, `/healthz`   | The HTTP server is live.                                                                                      | Process liveness and restart decisions.                        |
| `/startup`, `/startupz` | Startup work is complete and the Gateway is not draining. Channel health is not consulted.                    | Orchestrator startup and traffic admission.                    |
| `/ready`, `/readyz`     | Startup is complete, the Gateway is not draining, and configured channel accounts pass deep readiness checks. | Operator monitoring that should surface hard channel failures. |

`/startupz` returns `503` with `status: "starting"` while startup sidecars are pending, `503` with `status: "draining"` during drain, and `200` with `status: "started"` otherwise. Use it for Kubernetes, Fly, Render, and similar traffic admission. A broken Telegram or other channel account can make `/readyz` return `503` without taking a healthy Control UI out of service through `/startupz`.

Remote unauthenticated startup responses contain only `ok` and `status`. Local-direct and authenticated callers also receive `version`, `uptimeMs`, and `pendingReason` while startup is pending. Readiness details follow the same local-or-authenticated gate because they can name failing subsystems.

### CPU pressure and event-loop delay

Detailed readiness can include the latest completed `eventLoop` diagnostic
snapshot. The sampler owns observation windows; health reads do not reset a
pending measurement. No snapshot is available until the first window completes. Its
`cpuCoreRatio` measures user and system CPU time across the whole Gateway process,
including worker and native threads, divided by elapsed wall time. The unit is
core equivalents: `1` means one CPU core fully occupied over the interval, and
parallel work can produce values above `1`. It is not a percentage of the host's
total CPU capacity.

The Control UI's **System busyness** overlay reads the same sampler through
`status.eventLoop` on both Node and Bun. Its CPU percentage uses `100%` for one
fully occupied core. CPU and delay show a dash until the first sample completes;
a persistent dash means the telemetry is unavailable, not zero CPU usage.

Event-loop delay and utilization describe the main thread separately. A `cpu`
degradation reason reports process CPU pressure with delay co-evidence; it does
not identify the thread consuming CPU or prove a main-thread hang. Inspect the
delay measurements alongside CPU pressure. The `eventLoop` diagnostic does not
change the readiness result by itself.

## Uptime monitoring

External uptime monitoring services should use the dedicated `/health` endpoint, not `/v1/chat/completions`.

## Selected readiness criteria

Without a `gateway.readiness` section, `/ready` and `/readyz` use the existing
Gateway lifecycle and channel checks projected into a versioned canonical
result. Adding the section opts the Gateway into additional bounded condition
evaluation; an empty section selects no additional criteria.

An operator can add registered criteria to the Gateway's lifecycle readiness
conditions without selecting a hosting profile:

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    readiness: {
      requiredCriteria: ["openclaw.workspace-writable", "plugin.storage.backend"],
      advisoryCriteria: [
        "openclaw.config-current",
        "openclaw.event-loop-healthy",
        "openclaw.model-route-ready",
        "openclaw.secrets-ready",
        "plugin.policy.conformant",
        "plugin.metrics.exporter",
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

A plugin criterion is advisory when registered. Listing it in
`requiredCriteria` makes `False`, `Unknown`, timeout, plugin absence, and
registration absence block `/ready` and `/readyz`. Listing it in
`advisoryCriteria` includes failures in diagnostics without blocking readiness.
A criterion cannot appear in both lists.

Core selector IDs are configuration identifiers, not condition types. For
example, selecting `openclaw.workspace-writable` emits the canonical
`WorkspaceWritable` condition; plugin criteria use their namespaced ID as the
condition type.

Canonical results declare observed runtime subjects once under `identity`, and
each condition references its primary `subjectRef`. Every ID follows its
owner's renewal boundary: a host instance ID lasts for one host-defined
workload, a process ID lasts for one OS process, and a Gateway ID lasts for one
serving lifecycle. OpenClaw always generates the process and Gateway IDs. Set
`OPENCLAW_INSTANCE_ID` only when a host needs a separate workload correlation
subject; OpenClaw emits a one-way fingerprint rather than the supplied value.
Rotate the value when that host-level workload identity is replaced.

`generation` records an owner-defined revision that does not replace the
subject, such as an active config revision. When
`ReadinessEvaluationComplete` is not `True`, consumers must not interpret
missing conditions as deselection or owner deactivation.

Dynamic subject IDs, generations, node-specific references, and messages are
diagnostic fields, not metric labels. Telemetry exporters should use bounded
dimensions such as condition type, status, requirement, reason, subject kind,
and selected profile.

Core activation criteria inspect the Gateway's already-published runtime
generation. They do not read configuration or credentials from disk, discover
providers, call a model, or probe an external service.

| Selector ID                   | Condition           | What it verifies                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `openclaw.config-current`     | `ConfigCurrent`     | Active config matches the latest source generation     |
| `openclaw.event-loop-healthy` | `EventLoopHealthy`  | Gateway event-loop delay remains below its threshold   |
| `openclaw.model-route-ready`  | `ModelRouteReady`   | Default model is cataloged and has available auth      |
| `openclaw.plugins-loaded`     | `PluginsLoaded`     | Selected plugins loaded without activation failures    |
| `openclaw.secrets-ready`      | `SecretsReady`      | No runtime owner is degraded by secret resolution      |
| `openclaw.workspace-writable` | `WorkspaceWritable` | Default workspace accepts a bounded write/delete check |

These criteria are evaluated only when selected. Put one in
`advisoryCriteria` to observe it first, then move it to `requiredCriteria` when
that condition should block new work. `PluginsLoaded` and `EventLoopHealthy`
remain always-present advisories unless their selectors promote them. The plugin
condition includes plugins quarantined before activation as well as loader
errors.

The bundled Policy plugin demonstrates a plugin-owned criterion. When selected,
`plugin.policy.conformant` reuses the plugin's policy evaluation and reports
whether it produced any findings. Keep it in `advisoryCriteria` to expose drift
without changing the HTTP readiness status; promote it to `requiredCriteria`
only when policy conformance is an admission requirement.

OpenClaw also exposes opt-in criteria for the agent execution surfaces that a
host may depend on:

| Selector ID                     | Condition            | What it observes                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `openclaw.context-engine-ready` | `ContextEngineReady` | The selected context engine has a runtime registration and is not quarantined. |
| `openclaw.tool-catalog-ready`   | `ToolCatalogReady`   | The runtime health store has no active tool-schema quarantines.                |
| `openclaw.mcp-runtime-ready`    | `McpRuntimeReady`    | Every configured agent's MCP definitions loaded without owner diagnostics.     |
| `openclaw.sandbox-ready`        | `SandboxReady`       | Every sandbox-enabled agent references a registered sandbox backend.           |
| `openclaw.harness-ready`        | `HarnessReady`       | Every configured native harness runtime is registered.                         |

These checks are observational. They do not create a session, connect to an MCP
server, start a sandbox, invoke a tool, instantiate a context engine, or call a
model. MCP discovery is captured when the Gateway accepts the runtime
configuration; readiness requests read that captured summary. The other checks
read bounded owner registries, configuration, or capped runtime-health records.
Select only the capabilities that the deployment promises, and promote one to
`requiredCriteria` only when its absence means the Gateway must not receive
work.

Built-in state and background-service lifecycle selectors are observational.
They never open a database, install a delivery callback, start cron, or run
recovery from a readiness request. Session storage is the one active check in
this group and only creates bounded temporary probes:

- `openclaw.state-ready` reports whether the shared state database is active.
- `openclaw.session-storage-ready` verifies the state root and configured
  session-store parents with bounded, cached write, flush, and cleanup probes.
- `openclaw.delivery-runtime-ready` reports whether durable session delivery
  recovery has an active runtime owner.
- `openclaw.scheduler-ready` reports the scheduler lifecycle and startup
  recovery state. A scheduler disabled by configuration is satisfied.

These criteria are not evaluated until selected. Put them in
`requiredCriteria` only when that service is required by the deployment.

- **DO use:** `GET /health` - instant response, no session created, no LLM call, returns `{"ok":true,"status":"live"}`
- **DON'T use:** `/v1/chat/completions` for health checks - each request creates a full agent session with skill snapshot, context assembly, and LLM calls

When no `x-openclaw-session-key` header or `user` field is provided, `/v1/chat/completions` generates a new random session for each request. Monitoring services that ping every 15 minutes create ~96 sessions/day, each consuming 4-22KB. Over time this causes session store bloat and can lead to context window overflow.

### Monitoring service setup examples

- **BetterStack:** Set health check URL to `https://<your-gateway-host>:<port>/health`
- **UptimeRobot:** Add a new HTTP monitor with URL `https://<your-gateway-host>:<port>/health`
- **Generic:** Any HTTP GET to `/health` returns 200 with `{"ok":true,"status":"live"}` while the gateway's HTTP server is live

## When something fails

- `logged out` or status 409-515 -> relink with `openclaw channels logout` then `openclaw channels login`.
- Gateway unreachable -> start it: `openclaw gateway --port 18789` (use `--force` if the port is busy).
- No inbound messages -> confirm linked phone is online and the sender is allowed (`channels.whatsapp.allowFrom`); for group chats, ensure allowlist + mention rules match (`channels.whatsapp.groups`, `agents.entries.*.groupChat.mentionPatterns`).

## Dedicated "health" command

`openclaw health` asks the running gateway for its health snapshot (no direct channel
sockets from the CLI). By default it returns a fresh cached gateway snapshot and the
gateway refreshes that cache in the background; `--verbose` forces a live probe instead.
Connections and cached health reads share a one-minute background refresh cadence, so
repeated diagnostic connections do not each rebuild the health snapshot. Explicit live
probes and refreshes for missing or stale health still run immediately.
Snapshots describe loaded and configured channels. Stored credentials alone do not
activate a channel or add it to Gateway health; use channel setup to enable it.
The command reports linked creds/auth age when available, per-channel probe summaries,
session-store summary, and probe duration. Live probes use bounded account concurrency
and a Gateway-owned deadline, so one slow account returns a structured timeout while
completed sibling results remain available. The command exits non-zero if the gateway is
unreachable or the Gateway call itself times out.

### Queue warnings

A successful health RPC reports top-level `ok: true`. That value means the Gateway
produced the snapshot; it does not mean every delivery queue is clear. Check
`deliveryQueues.ingressPressure` for durable inbound lanes that may be blocking later
events. The field is omitted when no pressured lanes are found.

Ingress pressure uses conservative built-in diagnostic thresholds, not authoritative
retry or claim policy for any plugin. A durable lane appears only when an active pending
or claimed row has either reached at least eight attempts and has a recorded delivery
error, or a claimed row has not refreshed its claim for 30 minutes. Ordinary retries
1-7 are absent. Claim-recovery increments without a recorded error are also absent,
while live claims stay absent because their claim timestamp is refreshed. Rows without
a durable lane key are omitted because they cannot prove that later events are blocked;
runtime persists a derived lane after a real derived-lane retry.

Each result is grouped by channel account and reports pressured lane, pending, claimed,
and blocked counts plus the oldest affected receive time. All active rows in a pressured
lane contribute to those counts. The snapshot never includes lane IDs, event IDs,
payloads, claim owners or tokens, recorded errors, or session and target identifiers.

Options:

- `--json`: machine-readable JSON output
- `--timeout <ms>`: override the default 10s Gateway connection timeout; it does not widen the Gateway's internal live-probe deadline
- `--verbose`: force a live probe and print gateway connection details
- `--debug`: alias for `--verbose`

The health snapshot includes: `ok` (boolean), `ts` (timestamp), `durationMs` (probe time), per-channel status, agent availability, session-store summary, and optional delivery-queue warnings.
