This page is an index. The release runbook is documented on nine pages, one
per reader job. Open the page that matches your task and complete it there;
no procedure is split across pages.

OpenClaw exposes four user-facing update channels:

- stable: the promoted regular release on npm `latest`
- extended-stable: the trailing completed month's `.33+` maintenance line on
  npm `extended-stable`
- beta: prerelease tags on npm `beta`
- dev: the moving head of `main`

Extended-stable ships the trailing month's Gateway, official npm plugins, and
Docker images without moving regular `latest` or `main` selectors.

Tideclaw alpha builds are a separate internal prerelease track (npm dist-tag `alpha`), covered under [NPM workflow inputs](/reference/releasing/npm-workflow-inputs) and [Release test boxes](/reference/releasing/test-boxes).

## What each page covers

- [Version naming and cadence](/reference/releasing/versioning) — release version formats, git tags, npm dist-tags, and the beta-first cadence.
- [Release preflight](/reference/releasing/preflight) — checks, generators, and manual workflows to run before a release is tagged.
- [Regular release checklist](/reference/releasing/regular-release) — the twelve-step operator checklist for cutting a regular beta or stable release.
- [Release test boxes](/reference/releasing/test-boxes) — Full Release Validation and the Vitest, Docker, QA Lab, and Package boxes.
- [Release publish automation](/reference/releasing/publish-automation) — OpenClaw Release Publish order, tooling tags, and Windows, Android, and ClawHub recovery.
- [Beta and latest release sequence](/reference/releasing/beta-latest-sequence) — the orchestrated eight-step regular stable release sequence and dist-tag promotion.
- [Stable main closeout](/reference/releasing/main-closeout) — bringing main to the shipped release state and recovering a failed closeout.
- [Extended-stable monthly release](/reference/releasing/extended-stable) — the monthly Gateway extended-stable lane: prepare, publish, verify, and recover.
- [NPM workflow inputs](/reference/releasing/npm-workflow-inputs) — operator-controlled inputs for the npm release, publish, and release-check workflows.

## Where each section moved

Every section heading from the previous single-page version keeps its anchor here, so an existing link such as `/reference/RELEASING#release-preflight` still resolves. Each entry points at the page that now holds the content.
