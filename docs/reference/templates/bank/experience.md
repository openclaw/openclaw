# Experience Log

> First-person record of significant activities. Not raw memory (that's `memory/`).
> This is distilled: why it mattered, what you learned, what you'd do differently.

Format per entry:

```
## YYYY-MM — [project or theme]

**Did:** [what happened, 1-2 sentences]
**Learned:** [the non-obvious insight]
**Would do differently:** [optional — only if you'd change something]
```
