summary: "The @openclaw/ai npm package: reusable model transports, isolated runtimes, and host policy ports"
title: "@openclaw/ai package"
read_when:
  - You want to reuse OpenClaw's model transports in another application
  - You are changing packages/ai or the AI transport host ports
  - You are reviewing what the openclaw release publishes to npm besides the root package
---

`@openclaw/ai` is the publishable library form of OpenClaw's model execution
layer: provider-neutral message/tool/stream contracts, validation, diagnostics,
event streams, an isolated runtime registry, and lazy adapters for the eight
built-in API families (Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Completions, OpenAI
Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, ChatGPT/Codex Responses, Google Generative
AI, Google Vertex, Mistral Conversations).

It publishes alongside the root `openclaw` package on every release, pinned to
the same version. Its exact-pinned direct dependencies resolve at install time;
the package ships no npm lockfile. Installing `openclaw` installs the matching
`@openclaw/ai` automatically, and library consumers can depend on it directly
without any OpenClaw application code.

## Quick start

```js
import { createLlmRuntime } from "@openclaw/ai";
import { registerBuiltInApiProviders } from "@openclaw/ai/providers";

const runtime = createLlmRuntime();
registerBuiltInApiProviders(runtime.registry);

const stream = runtime.streamSimple(model, { messages }, { apiKey });
for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.type === "text_delta") process.stdout.write(event.delta);
}
const result = await stream.result();
```

A runnable version lives in the repository at `examples/ai-chat`.

## Design contract

- **Instance-scoped by default.** Importing the package registers nothing
  globally. `createApiRegistry()` / `createLlmRuntime()` return isolated
  instances; `registerBuiltInApiProviders(registry)` opts one registry into the
  built-in transports. Provider SDK modules load lazily on first use.
- **Host policy is injected, not bundled.** Request fetch guarding (for
  example SSRF policy), secret redaction of tool-result replay text, OpenAI
  strict-tool defaults, diagnostics logging, and typed transport-event
  observation are `AiTransportHost` ports configured with
  `configureAiTransportHost`. `buildModelFetchWithBlockingDispatchGuard` owns
  the fail-closed `beforeFetchDispatch` callback for every physical fetch hop
  after SSRF and DNS preflight but before network dispatch. Throwing prevents
  that hop, and hosts that cannot install the named guard fail closed.
  `buildModelFetchWithDispatchAttestation` is the separate optional port for
  non-blocking per-hop observation. Both named ports require a structured
  `AiModelFetchResult` with `dispatch_attested` provenance; the legacy
  `buildModelFetch` port is callable-only and cannot attest dispatch.
  Within those ports, `observeFetchDispatch` runs once per physical hop,
  including redirects. `onFetchDispatch` remains isolated observational
  accounting, runs once per provider-request fetch invocation, and cannot alter
  provider behavior. One attempt means one dispatched provider request,
  distinct from its physical fetch hops;
  connection setup and prewarm do not count as attempts. A zero-submission fact
  means the route phase ended before the dispatch boundary. Exact zero requires
  a structured `AiModelFetchResult` with `dispatch_attested` provenance; a
  legacy bare fetch without callback evidence remains unavailable. Transport
  fallback stages a concrete target until a matching attempt or zero-submission
  phase consumes it. A server-side serving-model fallback is in-stream
  submission evidence and does not rewrite the requested provider/model/API
  identity.
  Directly injected provider SDK clients remain supported, but their endpoint
  and transport authority is partial/unverified because OpenClaw cannot attest
  the client's physical hops.
  Scoped coverage can mark provider-fallback identity lower-bound when terminal
  metadata is unavailable, or mark transport semantics unverified when endpoint
  authority or terminal completion is ambiguous. Emitted event totals and
  dispatch-attested attempt totals remain exact; attempt totals behind directly
  injected clients remain lower-bound or unavailable. The library default
  observer is inert; OpenClaw installs its collector in its stream facade.
  Provider coverage depends on which adapters emit these facts.
- **One event-stream identity.** `@openclaw/ai/event-stream` is the canonical
  `EventStream` constructor shared by OpenClaw core, agent-core, and external
  consumers.
- **`internal/*` subpaths are not API.** They exist for the OpenClaw
  application itself and carry no semver guarantee.
- Provider ids, credentials, model catalogs, retries, and failover remain
  application concerns. OpenClaw layers those around this package; a library
  consumer supplies a `Model` object and options directly.
