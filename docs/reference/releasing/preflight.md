## Release preflight

### Previous updater compatibility

Before freezing the release, refresh `scripts/lib/update-compat-inventory.json`
from every release in the supported upgrade window. The current window includes
2026.9.1, 2026.9.2, and 2026.9.3. Download each npm tarball and verify it against
its published `dist.integrity` before extracting it. Pass each verified artifact
to the recorder with a repeatable `--release` argument:

```bash
pnpm update:compat:gen \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.1-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>' \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.2-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>' \
  --release '<unpacked-2026.9.3-directory>=<verified-npm-dist.integrity>'
```

The recorder writes releases in version order and replaces the recorded set.
Drop releases older than the supported upgrade window when regenerating it;
the inventory must not accumulate indefinitely. A release with no post-swap
imports still has an entry with an empty chunk list, so coverage is explicit.
Conflicting origins for the same chunk export across releases fail generation.

`pnpm update:compat:check` reads `npm view openclaw dist-tags --json` and requires
the versions tagged `latest` and `beta` to be present, even when both tags refer
to stable versions or the same version. A missing version fails with the exact
`pnpm update:compat:gen` command to run after verifying and unpacking the listed
artifacts. `pnpm release:prep`, version preparation, and prepared-release packing
run this check. Ordinary PR checks and source packing do not query npm for it.
To verify deterministic regeneration offline, run `pnpm update:compat:check`
with the same `--release` arguments used for generation.

The recorder scans emitted lazy imports in the updater, service, and CLI cleanup source
regions and records required export origins. The wizard entry is excluded
because it starts before replacement. `runtime-postbuild` generates hashed
compatibility files by re-exporting the candidate's corresponding symbols;
missing or ambiguous mappings fail the build. Stable entrypoints are checked
without replacement. The package carries the inventory in
`dist/update-compat-inventory.json`, so negative and future fixtures remove that
candidate's bridges. Existing older compatibility aliases remain separately
owned by their original upgrade contracts.

The default `update-first-hop-compat` lane runs each recorded release against the
candidate, with separate artifacts per version. Published updaters may correctly
skip a same-version tarball, so the lane stamps only test-artifact version metadata:
first hop `2026.9.99-first-hop.0` retains compatibility bridges; second hop
`2026.9.99-first-hop.1` removes them. The original candidate stays unchanged, and
transformation receipts bind package digests and every changed or removed member.
Both hops still require the exact installed build identity and a restarted service. The 2026.9.1 negative control demonstrates the
missing restart import; releases that already preload that helper record the
negative control as not applicable while retaining the positive first-hop and
bridge-free future-hop checks. An explicit source tarball still selects one
baseline. Run the published upgrade survivor lane from the oldest supported
release as well. Native Windows proof must invoke the old updater with
a registered Scheduled Task and verify its restart without a subsequent manual
`gateway start`. Import compatibility alone does not prove that old and new
modules share process-local state.

### Design proposal: immutable runtime generations

A durable replacement would install each version in an immutable generation
directory and switch an installation pointer. Launchers must resolve that
pointer before starting Node so lazy imports keep the process's original tree.
Retain generations until their processes have exited. This is a proposal, not
the current update layout.

The design must preserve npm's ownership and bookkeeping: `npm ls -g`, later
global installs and uninstall, lifecycle scripts, and generated launchers must
still work. Unix uses `<prefix>/lib/node_modules` and `<prefix>/bin`; Windows
uses `<prefix>/node_modules` and prefix-root launchers. A mutable junction alone
does not pin old imports, and Windows pointer replacement must respect open
handles and junction semantics. npm must not replace or orphan the retained
generation anchor during its next install.

pnpm owns a global project, manifests, lockfiles, virtual-store links, and
version-dependent package groups; its cleanup must not collect live generations.
Bun also owns a shared global project and separate binary directory, and its
Windows binary launchers currently cannot be relocated by this updater.
Generation activation must preserve sibling packages and the existing
concurrent-project checks for both managers. These constraints need separate
design approval and package-manager integration proof before implementation.

### Required checks

- Run `pnpm check:test-types` before release preflight so test TypeScript stays covered outside the faster local `pnpm check` gate.
- Run `pnpm check:architecture` before release preflight so the broader import cycle and architecture boundary checks are green outside the faster local gate.
- Run `pnpm build && pnpm ui:build` before `pnpm release:check` so the expected `dist/*` release artifacts and Control UI bundle exist for the pack validation step.
- Run `pnpm release:prep` after the root version bump and before tagging. It runs every deterministic release generator that commonly drifts after a version or config change: plugin versions, plugin inventory, base config schema, bundled channel config metadata, config docs baseline, plugin SDK exports, and Control UI locale bundles. It also blocks until native app translations and platform-generated locale resources match the source inventory; if they lag, wait for or dispatch `Native App Locale Refresh` before freezing the Code SHA. `pnpm release:check` re-runs those guards plus transient npm package-lock validation in check mode (including the strict locale gates plus the plugin SDK surface budget) and reports every failure in one pass before running package release checks. The npm preflight separately compares the exact release SHA with the prior published dist-tag and reports any Plugin SDK API changes.
- For reviewed native translation repairs, configure the translation provider and run `pnpm native:i18n:sync --locale <code> --refresh-id <native-id>`. Find IDs in `apps/.i18n/native-source.json`; repeat the selector for up to 64 distinct IDs. Selected entries join ordinary pending work, including missing strings and glossary invalidation. Requests include bounded nearby owner code and instructions to preserve printf argument roles; excerpts are request-only and do not enter the source inventory. Unknown IDs fail before provider work, and selected refresh cannot be combined with `--force`. Then run `pnpm native:i18n:sync` to regenerate platform resources and `pnpm native:i18n:check` to validate them.
- For reviewed Control UI translation repairs, run `pnpm ui:i18n:sync --locale <code> --refresh-key <key>`. Repeat the selector for up to 64 distinct catalog keys. It refreshes those keys alongside ordinary pending work while leaving still-valid unselected cached aliases reusable. A configured provider is required even when ordinary synchronization allows optional authentication; unknown keys and combining selected refresh with `--force` are rejected.
- Plugin version sync updates the publishable `@openclaw/ai` runtime package, official plugin package versions, and existing `openclaw.compat.pluginApi` floors to the OpenClaw release version by default. Treat that field as the plugin SDK/runtime API floor, not just a copy of the package version: for plugin-only releases that intentionally remain compatible with older OpenClaw hosts, keep the floor at the oldest supported host API and document that choice in the plugin release proof.
- Run the manual `Full Release Validation` workflow before release approval to select the pre-release test boxes from one entrypoint. It accepts a branch, tag, or full commit SHA and dispatches manual `CI`, plugin prerelease, and `OpenClaw Release Checks` for the selected profile. Canonical beta `all` without soak uses the bounded `npm-beta-v1` policy described in [Full release validation](/reference/full-release-validation); install, package, Linux cross-OS, QA parity, runtime-pair/restart, and tool-coverage gates remain; Windows/macOS cross-OS outcomes are advisory. Stable and full runs always include exhaustive live/E2E and Docker release-path soak; `run_release_soak=true` requests an explicit beta soak. Package Acceptance provides package Telegram E2E when selected, avoiding a second concurrent live poller for an unpublished candidate.

  Provide `release_package_spec` after publishing a beta to reuse the shipped npm package across release checks, Package Acceptance, and package Telegram E2E without rebuilding the release tarball. Provide `npm_telegram_package_spec` only when Telegram should use a different published package from the rest of release validation. Provide `package_acceptance_package_spec` when Package Acceptance should use a different published package from the release package spec. Provide `evidence_package_spec` when the release evidence report should prove that validation matches a published npm package without forcing Telegram E2E.

  ```bash
  TOOLING_SHA="<recorded-full-main-ancestor-sha>"
  node scripts/full-release-validation-at-sha.mjs \
    --sha <code-sha> \
    --target-ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH \
    --workflow-sha "$TOOLING_SHA"
  ```

- Run the manual `Package Acceptance` workflow when you want side-channel proof for a package candidate while release work continues. Use `source=npm` for `openclaw@beta`, `openclaw@latest`, or an exact release version; `source=ref` to pack a trusted `package_ref` branch/tag/SHA with the current `workflow_ref` harness; `source=url` for a public HTTPS tarball with a required SHA-256 and strict public URL policy; `source=trusted-url` for a named trusted-source policy using required `trusted_source_id` and SHA-256; or `source=artifact` for a tarball uploaded by another GitHub Actions run.

  The workflow resolves the candidate to `package-under-test`, reuses the Docker E2E release scheduler against that tarball, and can run Telegram QA against the same tarball with `telegram_mode=mock-openai` or `telegram_mode=live-frontier`. When the selected Docker lanes include `published-upgrade-survivor`, the package artifact is the candidate and `published_upgrade_survivor_baseline` selects the published baseline. `update-restart-auth` uses the candidate package as both the installed CLI and the package-under-test so it exercises the candidate update command's managed restart path.

  Example:

  ```bash
  gh workflow run package-acceptance.yml --ref main -f workflow_ref=main -f source=npm -f package_spec=openclaw@beta -f suite_profile=product -f published_upgrade_survivor_baseline=openclaw@2026.4.26 -f telegram_mode=mock-openai
  ```

  Common profiles:
  - `smoke`: install/channel/agent, gateway network, and config reload lanes
  - `package`: artifact-native package/update/restart/plugin lanes without OpenWebUI or live ClawHub
  - `product`: package profile plus MCP channels, cron/subagent cleanup, OpenAI web search, and OpenWebUI
  - `full`: Docker release-path chunks with OpenWebUI
  - `custom`: exact `docker_lanes` selection for a focused rerun

- Run the manual `CI` workflow directly when you only need deterministic normal CI coverage for the release candidate. Manual CI dispatches bypass changed scoping and force the Linux Node shards, bundled-plugin shards, plugin and channel contract shards, Node 24 minimum compatibility, `check-*`, `check-additional-*`, built-artifact smoke checks, docs checks, Python skills, Windows, macOS, and Control UI i18n lanes. Standalone manual CI defaults to full coverage and runs Android only with `include_android=true`. Full Release Validation includes Android except under `npm-beta-v1`, which selects `release_scope=npm-beta` and defers native app CI while retaining macOS and Windows Node checks.

  ```bash
  gh workflow run ci.yml --ref release/YYYY.M.PATCH -f include_android=true
  ```

- Run `pnpm qa:otel:smoke` when validating release telemetry. It exercises QA-lab through a local OTLP/HTTP receiver and verifies trace, metric, and log export plus bounded trace attributes and content/identifier redaction without requiring Opik, Langfuse, or another external collector.
- Run `pnpm qa:otel:collector-smoke` when validating collector compatibility. It routes the same QA-lab OTLP export through a real OpenTelemetry Collector Docker container before the local receiver assertions.
- Run `pnpm qa:prometheus:smoke` when validating protected Prometheus scraping. It exercises QA-lab, rejects unauthenticated scrapes, and verifies release-critical metric families stay free of prompt content, raw identifiers, auth tokens, and local paths.
- Run `pnpm qa:observability:smoke` for the source-checkout OpenTelemetry and Prometheus smoke lanes back to back.
- Run `pnpm release:check` before every tagged release.
- `OpenClaw NPM Preflight` packs the publishable tarball once, then generates dependency release evidence while qualifying those exact bytes. The npm advisory vulnerability gate is release-blocking. The transitive manifest risk, dependency ownership/install surface, dependency change, and npm package-lock mirror reports are release evidence only. The npm mirrors include the root package and every publishable workspace package with runtime dependencies or optional dependencies, generated and verified against the source checkout’s `pnpm-lock.yaml`. They are never included in npm tarballs. The dependency change report compares the release candidate with the previous reachable release tag. The preflight uploads dependency evidence as `openclaw-release-dependency-evidence-<tag>` and also embeds it under `dependency-evidence/` inside the prepared npm preflight artifact. The real publish path reuses that preflight artifact, then attaches the same evidence to the GitHub release as `openclaw-<version>-dependency-evidence.zip`.
- **Downstream packagers:** Download `openclaw-<version>-dependency-evidence.zip` from the GitHub release and read `dependency-evidence/npm-package-locks.json` (`schemaVersion: 1`). Select the entry in `packages` matching the exact package `name` and `version` you pin. Every entry has an `omittedWorkspaceDependencies` array; a nonempty array marks a partial lock, and consumers must reject that entry instead of installing it. Sibling workspace packages publish in the same release, so the generator omits their `workspace:` runtime references at preflight. The top-level `packagesWithOmittedWorkspaceDependencies` counts these partial entries. Only for an entry with an empty omissions array, serialize `entry.lock` as `package-lock.json` (two-space JSON indentation plus a trailing newline reproduces `entry.lockSha256`). This supports offline installation of lockless packages such as `@openclaw/acpx`; the report includes a `bundleRuntimeDependencies` flag and direct dependency counts. Before using a lock, verify that `dependency-evidence/dependency-evidence-manifest.json`’s `releaseSha` equals the report’s `sourceSha` and the OpenClaw commit you pin. The report also records the source `pnpm-lock.yaml` SHA-256. The companion `npm-package-locks.md` provides counts and a package table. The locks encode this repository's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides (for example a scoped `@openai/codex` pin for `codex-acp`), so nested dependency specs may not satisfy the locked versions by range alone: before running `npm ci`, either carry the same `overrides` in the consuming `package.json` or rewrite each entry's nested `dependencies`/`optionalDependencies` specs to the locked versions (nix-openclaw does the latter); a raw `npm ci` against an unmodified `package.json` otherwise fails its lock-sync check.
- Run `OpenClaw Release Publish` for the mutating publish sequence after the tag exists. Dispatch regular beta and stable publishes from the protected `release-publish/<tooling-sha12>-<epoch>` tag at the frozen Tooling SHA; the release tag still selects the exact target commit and may point into `release/YYYY.M.PATCH`. Tideclaw alpha publishes remain on their matching alpha branch. Pass the successful OpenClaw npm `preflight_run_id`, successful `full_release_validation_run_id`, and exact `full_release_validation_run_attempt`, and keep the default plugin publish scope `all-publishable` unless you are deliberately running a focused repair. The workflow dispatches plugin npm and ClawHub together, then starts core npm once plugin npm succeeds. Core npm does not wait for ClawHub authorization or bootstrap; the exact ClawHub receipt remains a required parent step. When the tagged Android pin matches the stable release train, Android qualification runs independently and dispatch follows successful core npm publication; a mismatched pin records an explicit skip. Optional Windows promotion starts after GitHub finalization as a detached child. Android approval, build, and publication are monitored separately and do not hold core publication; the child can attach its verified assets after the GitHub release becomes public. Publish reruns are resumable: an already-published core npm version skips the core dispatch after the workflow proves the registry tarball matches the tag's preflight artifact, and Windows/Android promotion is skipped when the release already carries the verified asset contract, so a retry only redoes the failed stages. Focused plugin-only repairs require `plugin_publish_scope=selected` and a nonempty plugin list. Plugin-only `all-publishable` runs require complete immutable preflight and Full Release Validation evidence; partial evidence is rejected.
- Stable `OpenClaw Release Publish` accepts optional `windows_node_tag` and `windows_node_installer_digests` inputs together. Omit both to skip Windows dispatch. When supplied, the parent finalizes the GitHub release on npm and Docker evidence, then dispatches `Windows Node Release` independently with the approved digest map unchanged. The child validates the exact published, non-prerelease source release, downloads the signed x64/ARM64 installers, matches the pinned digests, verifies the expected OpenClaw Foundation Authenticode signer on Windows, and attaches the installers plus SHA-256 manifest to the published OpenClaw release. It re-downloads the promoted assets to verify membership and hashes. Windows failures are reported in the child summary and evidence without failing the parent or reverting the public release to draft.

  To attach Windows assets later or recover promotion, use the [manual recovery command](/reference/releasing/publish-automation#regular-release-publish-automation) with exact target/source tags and the approved `expected_installer_digests` map. Recovery rejects unexpected `OpenClawCompanion-*` asset names before replacing the expected contract with the pinned source bytes. Website download links should target exact OpenClaw release asset URLs for the current stable release, or `releases/latest/download/...` only after verifying GitHub's latest redirect points at that same release; do not link only to the companion repo release page.

- Release checks run in a separate manual workflow: `OpenClaw Release Checks`. The `all`, `qa-parity`, and direct `qa` groups select QA Lab parity, runtime-pair/restart proof, and runtime tool coverage. The Matrix catalog and Telegram QA-live lanes run for stable/full all-group validation, soak-enabled all-group validation, or an explicit `qa`/`qa-live` rerun group. Bounded beta-publish `all` without soak defers those live lanes to postpublish-confidence. The live lanes use the `qa-live-shared` environment; Telegram also uses Convex CI credential leases.
- Cross-OS install and upgrade runtime validation is part of public `OpenClaw Release Checks` and `Full Release Validation`, which call the reusable workflow `.github/workflows/openclaw-cross-os-release-checks-reusable.yml` directly. Linux cross-OS lanes gate publication. Windows and macOS lanes run alongside them as advisory coverage, with actual pass/fail conclusions retained in the manifest and summary; their failures do not block npm publication.
- Secret-bearing release checks should be dispatched through `Full Release Validation` or from the `main`/release workflow ref so workflow logic and secrets stay controlled.
- `OpenClaw Release Checks` accepts a branch, tag, or full commit SHA as long as the resolved commit is reachable from an OpenClaw branch or release tag.
- `OpenClaw NPM Release` validation-only preflight also accepts the current full 40-character workflow-branch commit SHA without requiring a pushed tag. The SHA dispatch stays read-only; later publication requires a real release tag at the same validated SHA. In SHA mode the workflow synthesizes `v<package.json version>` only for the package metadata check; real publish still requires a real release tag.
- Both workflows keep the real publish and promotion path on GitHub-hosted runners, while the non-mutating validation path can use the larger Blacksmith Linux runners.
- That workflow runs `OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 OPENCLAW_LIVE_CACHE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live:cache` using both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` workflow secrets.
- npm release preflight no longer waits on the separate release checks lane.
- Before tagging a release candidate locally, run `RELEASE_TAG=vYYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N pnpm release:fast-pretag-check`. The helper runs the fast release guardrails, plugin npm/ClawHub release checks, build, UI build, and `release:openclaw:npm:check` in the order that catches common approval-blocking mistakes before the GitHub publish workflow starts.
- Plugin `openclaw.release.requireLatestDependencies` declarations remain release metadata, but npm `latest` drift is advisory. Checks warn with the plugin, dependency, pinned version, and current latest version; a failed latest lookup also warns and does not establish that the pin is unusable. Full Release Validation's Codex lanes validate the `@openclaw/codex` harness pin. Keep that frozen, tested pin when upstream publishes a newer version. Missing or malformed required runtime dependency metadata, package/install failures, and failed required validation lanes still block release.
- Run `RELEASE_TAG=vYYYY.M.PATCH node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-release-check.ts` (or the matching prerelease/correction tag) before approval.
- After npm publish, run `node --import tsx scripts/openclaw-npm-postpublish-verify.ts YYYY.M.PATCH` (or the matching beta/correction version) to verify the published registry install path in a fresh temp prefix.
- After a beta publish, run `OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_PACKAGE_SPEC=openclaw@YYYY.M.PATCH-beta.N OPENCLAW_NPM_TELEGRAM_CREDENTIAL_ROLE=maintainer pnpm test:docker:npm-telegram-live` with `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SITE_URL` and `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_MAINTAINER` set. This verifies installed-package onboarding, Telegram setup, and real Telegram E2E against the published npm package using the shared Test Server userbot pool. CI uses the `ci` role and `OPENCLAW_QA_CONVEX_SECRET_CI` instead.
- To run the full post-publish beta smoke from a maintainer machine, use `pnpm release:beta-smoke -- --beta betaN`. The helper runs Parallels npm update/fresh-target validation, dispatches `NPM Telegram Beta E2E`, polls the exact workflow run, downloads the artifact, and prints the Telegram report.
- Maintainers can run the same post-publish check from GitHub Actions via the manual `NPM Telegram Beta E2E` workflow. It is intentionally manual-only and does not run on every merge.
- Maintainer release automation uses preflight-then-promote:
  - Real npm publish must pass a successful npm `preflight_run_id`.
  - Regular beta and stable publish orchestration and preflight use trusted `main` against the exact target tag. Tideclaw alpha publish and preflight use the matching alpha branch.
  - Stable npm releases default to `beta`; stable npm publish can target `latest` explicitly via workflow input.
  - Token-based npm dist-tag mutation lives in `openclaw/releases/.github/workflows/openclaw-npm-dist-tags.yml` because `npm dist-tag add` still needs `NPM_TOKEN` while the source repo keeps OIDC-only publish.
  - Public `macOS Release` is validation-only; when a tag lives only on a release branch but the workflow is dispatched from `main`, set `public_release_branch=release/YYYY.M.PATCH`.
  - Real macOS publish must pass successful macOS `preflight_run_id` and `validate_run_id` in `openclaw/releases`. These app gates run independently and never hold npm or GitHub release finalization.
  - Real publish paths promote prepared artifacts instead of rebuilding them again.
- For stable correction releases like `YYYY.M.PATCH-N`, the post-publish verifier also checks the same temp-prefix upgrade path from `YYYY.M.PATCH` to `YYYY.M.PATCH-N` so release corrections cannot silently leave older global installs on the base stable payload.
- npm release preflight fails closed unless the tarball includes both `dist/control-ui/index.html` and a non-empty `dist/control-ui/assets/` payload, so we do not ship an empty browser dashboard again.
- Post-publish verification also checks that published plugin entrypoints and package metadata are present in the installed registry layout. A release that ships missing plugin runtime payloads fails the postpublish verifier and cannot be promoted to `latest`.
- `pnpm test:install:smoke` also enforces the npm pack `unpackedSize` budget on the candidate update tarball, so installer e2e catches accidental pack bloat before the release publish path.
- If the release work touched CI planning, extension timing manifests, or extension test matrices, regenerate and review the planner-owned `plugin-prerelease-extension-shard` matrix outputs from `.github/workflows/plugin-prerelease.yml` before approval so release notes do not describe a stale CI layout.
- Stable macOS release readiness also includes the updater surfaces: the GitHub release must end up with the packaged `.zip`, `.dmg`, and `.dSYM.zip`; `appcast.xml` on `main` must point at the new stable zip after publish (the macOS publish workflow commits it automatically, or opens an appcast PR when direct push is blocked); the packaged app must keep a non-debug bundle id, a non-empty Sparkle feed URL, and a `CFBundleVersion` at or above the canonical Sparkle build floor for that release version.
- Signed macOS packaging retains `dist/macos-notarization-recovery/` before waiting for Apple. It contains the exact signed app archive, symbols, submission IDs, available DMG, and source-bound SHA-256 inventory. Keep the complete checkpoint if notarization fails; do not rebuild or replace its files. Successful packaging marks it complete for artifact retention; the next ordinary package invocation verifies and retires that completed checkpoint automatically.
- Resume with `scripts/package-mac-dist.sh --resume-notarization` from the same source commit and version, with the original signing/notary credentials available. Recovery verifies the checkpoint, restores the signed app, and waits on existing Apple submissions. It creates a DMG only if that packaging step had not completed. Apple rejection, changed bytes, wrong source/version, or invalid signatures remain failures.
