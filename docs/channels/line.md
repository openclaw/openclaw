LINE connects to OpenClaw via the LINE Messaging API. The plugin runs as a webhook
receiver on the Gateway and uses your channel access token + channel secret for
authentication.

Status: official plugin, installed separately. Direct messages, group chats, media,
locations, Flex messages, template messages, and quick replies are supported.
Reactions and threads are not supported.

## Install

Install LINE before configuring the channel:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/line
```

Local checkout (when running from a git repo):

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./path/to/local/line-plugin
```

## Setup

1. Create a LINE Developers account and open the Console:
   [https://developers.line.biz/console/](https://developers.line.biz/console/)
2. Create (or pick) a Provider and add a **Messaging API** channel.
3. Copy the **Channel access token** and **Channel secret** from the channel settings.
4. Enable **Use webhook** in the Messaging API settings.
5. Set the webhook URL to your gateway endpoint (HTTPS required):

```text
https://gateway-host/line/webhook
```

The Gateway answers LINE's webhook verification (GET). For signed inbound events
(POST), it writes each event to the durable ingress queue before returning `200`;
agent processing continues asynchronously. Failed delivery is retried from the
queue, including after a Gateway restart, and poison events become failed queue
records after bounded retries. If durable persistence fails, the request returns
`500` instead of acknowledging an event that could be lost.
Delivery is at least once across the queue-to-agent boundary: a Gateway shutdown or
crash during an active delivery can replay the turn. Message events deduplicate by
LINE message ID; other event types use `webhookEventId`. Retained completion records
suppress ordinary duplicate webhooks, but handlers that perform external side effects
should still be idempotent.
If you need a custom path, set `channels.line.webhookPath` or
`channels.line.accounts.<id>.webhookPath` and update the URL accordingly.

Security notes:

- LINE signature verification is body-dependent (HMAC over the raw body), so OpenClaw applies a strict pre-auth body limit (64 KB) and read timeout before verification.
- OpenClaw processes webhook events from the verified raw request bytes. Upstream middleware-transformed `req.body` values are ignored for signature-integrity safety.

## Inbound durability

The [Setup](#setup) webhook contract acknowledges an event only after it is durably
queued. The durable `200` carries `x-openclaw-delivery-accepted: durable`; signed
verification pings (empty event lists) and error responses omit the marker, so
reverse proxies can require it to distinguish durable acceptance from a generic
`200`. From there, delivery runs through the core channel-ingress drain with
LINE-specific settings:

- **Per-conversation ordering.** Events are serialized by source lane —
  `group:<groupId>`, `room:<roomId>`, or `user:<userId>`; events without a
  conversation source use their own event-scoped lane. Within a lane, events
  dispatch in received order, so a retrying event delays later events in the same
  chat but never other chats. Up to 8 deliveries run concurrently across lanes.
- **Retries.** A failed delivery retries with exponential backoff starting at
  1 second and doubling per attempt, roughly two minutes of cumulative backoff
  across the window. After the 8th failed attempt the event dead-letters
  (`retry-limit-exceeded`) immediately: LINE opts out of the generic 24-hour
  dead-letter age floor so a poison event cannot block its conversation lane for
  a day.
- **Non-retryable failures.** These dead-letter immediately, with no further
  retries regardless of the attempt count: stored payloads that no longer parse
  (`invalid-event`), deliveries that already committed side effects
  (`delivery-side-effects-committed`), and LINE API authentication failures
  (`authentication-failed`, HTTP 401/403).
- **Stall watchdog.** A claimed delivery that never reaches agent-turn adoption
  dead-letters as `handler-timeout` after 5 minutes.
- **Crash recovery.** Every drain pass opens with a recovery sweep that reclaims
  any claim whose owning Gateway process is no longer running, so a delivery lost
  to a hard crash is retried on the next sweep rather than after a timeout. The
  30-minute claim lease is the fallback bound for the opposite case: it caps how
  long a claim stays protected while its owner still looks alive — a running
  process, or a reused PID whose process identity cannot be verified. Events
  accepted while the Gateway is stopping are still persisted and drain after the
  next start.
- **Duplicate suppression window.** Completed and failed queue records are
  retained for 30 days (up to 4096 entries each per account); while the record
  exists, a redelivered webhook for the same event is acknowledged without a
  second dispatch.

The `500`-on-persistence-failure contract recovers events only when **Webhook
redelivery** is enabled for the channel in the LINE Developers Console (Messaging
API settings). Without it, LINE does not re-send failed webhook deliveries, and an
event refused with `500` is lost.

Dead-lettered events stay inspectable and, depending on the failure reason,
recoverable; see [Inbound dead letters](/cli/channels#inbound-dead-letters) and
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

## Configure

Minimal config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    line: {
      enabled: true,
      channelAccessToken: "LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
      channelSecret: "LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
    },
  },
}
```

Public DM config:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    line: {
      enabled: true,
      channelAccessToken: "LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
      channelSecret: "LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET",
      dmPolicy: "open",
      allowFrom: ["*"],
    },
  },
}
```

Env vars (default account only):

- `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`

Token/secret files:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    line: {
      tokenFile: "/path/to/line-token.txt",
      secretFile: "/path/to/line-secret.txt",
    },
  },
}
```

`tokenFile` and `secretFile` must point to regular files. Symlinks are rejected.
Inline config values win over files; env vars are the last fallback for the default account.

Multiple accounts:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    line: {
      accounts: {
        marketing: {
          channelAccessToken: "...",
          channelSecret: "...",
          webhookPath: "/line/marketing",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Access control

Direct messages default to pairing. Unknown senders get a pairing code and their
messages are ignored until approved:

```bash
openclaw pairing list line
openclaw pairing approve line <CODE>
```

Allowlists and policies:

- `channels.line.dmPolicy`: `pairing | allowlist | open | disabled` (default `pairing`)
- `channels.line.allowFrom`: allowlisted LINE user IDs for DMs; `dmPolicy: "open"` requires `["*"]`
- `channels.line.groupPolicy`: `allowlist | open | disabled` (default `allowlist`)
- `channels.line.groupAllowFrom`: allowlisted LINE user IDs for groups; DM `allowFrom` entries do not admit group senders
- Per-group overrides: `channels.line.groups.<groupId>.allowFrom` (plus `enabled`, `requireMention`, `systemPrompt`, `skills`). With
  `groupPolicy: "allowlist"`, set `groupAllowFrom` or the per-group `allowFrom`; an empty group allowlist blocks group messages even when DMs are open.
- Static sender access groups can be referenced from `allowFrom`, `groupAllowFrom`, and per-group `allowFrom` with `accessGroup:<name>`; see [Access groups](/channels/access-groups).
- Runtime note: if `channels.line` is completely missing, runtime falls back to `groupPolicy="allowlist"` for group checks (even if `channels.defaults.groupPolicy` is set).

LINE IDs are case-sensitive. Valid IDs look like:

- User: `U` + 32 hex chars
- Group: `C` + 32 hex chars
- Room: `R` + 32 hex chars

## Message behavior

- Text is chunked at 5000 characters.
- Markdown formatting is stripped; code blocks and tables are converted into Flex
  cards when possible.
- Streaming responses are buffered; LINE receives full chunks with a loading
  animation while the agent works.
- Media downloads are capped by `channels.line.mediaMaxMb` (default 10).
- Inbound media is saved under `~/.openclaw/media/inbound/` before it is passed
  to the agent, matching the shared media store used by other channel plugins.

## Channel data (rich messages)

Use `channelData.line` to send quick replies, locations, Flex cards, or template
messages.

```json5
{
  text: "Here you go",
  channelData: {
    line: {
      quickReplies: ["Status", "Help"],
      location: {
        title: "Office",
        address: "123 Main St",
        latitude: 35.681236,
        longitude: 139.767125,
      },
      flexMessage: {
        altText: "Status card",
        contents: {/* Flex payload */},
      },
      templateMessage: {
        type: "confirm",
        text: "Proceed?",
        confirmLabel: "Yes",
        confirmData: "yes",
        cancelLabel: "No",
        cancelData: "no",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The LINE plugin also ships a `/card` command for Flex message presets:

```text
/card info "Welcome" "Thanks for joining!"
```

## ACP support

LINE supports ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) conversation bindings:

- `/acp spawn <agent> --bind here` binds the current LINE chat to an ACP session without creating a child thread.
- Configured ACP bindings and active conversation-bound ACP sessions work on LINE like other conversation channels.

See [ACP agents](/tools/acp-agents) for details.

## Outbound media

The LINE plugin sends images, videos, and audio through the agent message tool:

- **Images**: sent as LINE image messages; the preview image defaults to the media URL.
- **Videos**: require a preview image; set `channelData.line.previewImageUrl` to an image URL.
- **Audio**: sent as LINE audio messages; duration defaults to 60 seconds unless `channelData.line.durationMs` is set.

The media kind is taken from `channelData.line.mediaKind` when set, otherwise inferred
from the other LINE options or the URL file suffix, with image as the fallback.

Outbound media URLs must be public HTTPS URLs of at most 2000 characters. OpenClaw
validates the target hostname before handing the URL to LINE and rejects loopback,
link-local, and private-network targets.

Generic media sends without LINE-specific options use the image route.

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook verification fails:** ensure the webhook URL is HTTPS and the
  `channelSecret` matches the LINE console.
- **No inbound events:** confirm the webhook path matches `channels.line.webhookPath`
  and that the gateway is reachable from LINE.
- **Media download errors:** raise `channels.line.mediaMaxMb` if media exceeds the
  default limit.
- **Bot silently skips messages (events dead-lettered):** `openclaw logs` shows
  `line: spooled update <id> ... dead-lettered` lines with the failure reason.
  Inspect with `openclaw channels dead-letters list --channel line --account default`
  and check the failure reason before recovering: `resubmit` re-enqueues by event
  id without checking why the event failed. After fixing the cause of a failure
  with no committed side effects (for example `retry-limit-exceeded` after a
  provider outage), re-enqueue one event with
  `openclaw channels dead-letters resubmit <event-id> --channel line --account default`.
  Never resubmit a `delivery-side-effects-committed` event: that reason means the
  delivery already adopted an agent turn or consumed its reply token, so
  re-enqueuing repeats the committed work — for example a second visible reply.
  `openclaw health` reports dead-letter counts and `openclaw doctor` names
  affected accounts.
- **`handler-timeout` dead letters:** the delivery was claimed but no agent turn
  adopted it within 5 minutes, usually a hung agent run or a stalled provider.
  Check `openclaw logs --follow` around the failure age shown in the
  dead-letters list output.
