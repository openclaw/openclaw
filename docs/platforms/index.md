# Platforms

OpenClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway (WhatsApp/Telegram bugs).

Companion apps exist for macOS (menu bar app), Windows (tray companion MVP), and mobile
nodes (iOS/Android). Linux does not have a companion app yet, but the Gateway is fully
supported today.

Windows supports both native CLI flows and WSL2. WSL2 is still the recommended path for the
full Gateway service experience.

## Choose your OS

- macOS: [macOS](/platforms/macos)
- iOS: [iOS](/platforms/ios)
- Android: [Android](/platforms/android)
- Windows: [Windows](/platforms/windows)
- Linux: [Linux](/platforms/linux)

## Quick guidance

- Use **macOS** if you want the smoothest companion app experience today.
- Use **Windows + WSL2** if you want the most predictable Gateway host behavior on Windows.
- Use **native Windows** if you want a supported CLI path plus the tray companion MVP.
- Use **Linux** or **WSL2** if you want a headless or server-style Gateway host.
- Use **mobile** if you want nodes for local presence, notifications, or device features.

## Common links

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `openclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `openclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `openclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `openclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- macOS: LaunchAgent (`ai.openclaw.gateway` or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*`)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
