# Plan-Mode Rollout — Architecture & Status

**Last updated:** consolidation pass complete on `feat/plan-channel-parity` (post `01ed63633e`, see consolidation-pass section below). Branch is now rebased onto `upstream/main` @ `v2026.4.19-beta.2` and hosts the **umbrella PR #68939** which supersedes the 10-PR series.
**Live install (pre-rebase):** `OpenClaw 2026.4.15` from `feat/plan-channel-parity`
**Total PRs (historical):** 10 individual PRs A/B/C/D/E/F/7/8/10/11 (now closed) + 1 umbrella PR (#68939) carrying the full 135-commit history
**Backup branch:** `feat/plan-channel-parity-backup` at pre-rebase HEAD `bee5e8c364` (pushed to origin for rollback safety)

This document is the **single source of truth** for the plan-mode rollout. It survives Claude Code session compactions and is referenced by the umbrella PR + every closed PR's redirect comment.

## Consolidation pass — 2026-04-19

After 3+ weeks of iter-1/iter-2/iter-3 hardening on `feat/plan-channel-parity`, the 10 individual PRs reviewed against stale base branches were **consolidated into a single umbrella PR rebased onto current upstream/main**.

### Why consolidate

- Branch was **734 commits behind** `upstream/main` and **135 commits ahead**
- Latest upstream tag `v2026.4.19-beta.2` had landed ~24h before the rebase
- Review bots (Greptile, Copilot, Codex) were comparing PRs against 3-week-old main snapshots: re-firing on resolved threads, suggesting "fixes" for patterns that already landed elsewhere, drowning real signal in noise
- 10 dependent PRs forced maintainers to load the dependency graph just to start review

### What was preserved

- **Full 135-commit history** (no squash — `git blame` and the iter-1/2/3 narrative both stay readable)
- **240+ resolved review threads** from the original 10 PRs (rationale lives in this doc + commit messages)
- **All test coverage** (200+ tests across the touched surface — 81 scoped tests verified passing post-rebase)
- **All architecture decisions** documented in this file (sections below stay authoritative)

### Rebase mechanics — only 5 actual conflicts in 134 commits

Audit before rebase confirmed upstream had **zero plan-mode commits in the gap**. All conflicts were incidental file overlaps:

| File                                           | Type                                  | Resolution                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/agents/system-prompt.ts`                  | Import-only                           | Take both sets                                                                                                                                   |
| `ui/src/ui/views/chat.ts`                      | Import-only                           | Take HEAD (`SubagentBlockingStatus` is a strict superset)                                                                                        |
| `src/plugin-sdk/telegram.ts`                   | Modify/delete (upstream restructured) | `git rm` — PR-14 Telegram visibility deferred until plan-archetype-bridge re-wires to the new SDK location                                       |

| `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts` | Bootstrap-context refactor            | Drop our duplicated bootstrap blocks (upstream owns lines 654+); preserve `planModeAppendPrompt` + add `planModeFeatureEnabled` declaration      |

### Post-rebase residual fixes (`01ed63633e`)

Two type errors surfaced after the rebase landed and were fixed in a follow-on commit on the rebased branch:

- **`src/agents/plan-mode/plan-archetype-bridge.ts`** — replaced the `sendDocumentTelegram` call with a deferred no-op + `void` discards on the unused `caption`/`absPath`/`parseTelegramThreadId`. Plan markdown still persists to `~/.openclaw/agents/<id>/plans/`; Telegram attachment delivery awaits the PR-14 re-wire follow-up.
- **`src/gateway/server-runtime-subscriptions.ts`** — removed the `params.minimalTestGateway` conditional (the param was renamed/dropped in upstream's restructure). Persister always starts; tests pass `emitSessionsChanged: () => {}` to suppress.

The `parseTelegramThreadId` helper is preserved as commented-out code in `plan-archetype-bridge.ts` so the PR-14 re-wire follow-up can resurrect the parsing logic without rewriting it.

### Umbrella PR #68939 status

- **Branch:** `feat/plan-channel-parity` @ `01ed63633e`
- **Diff vs upstream/main:** 135 commits, 145 files changed
- **Greptile review:** SKIPPED (hit 100-file ceiling — known limitation; not actionable)
- **Copilot review:** triggered via `@copilot please review` comment
- **CI:** parity gate IN_PROGRESS at write-time
- **Mergeable:** ✅ MERGEABLE per `gh pr view`

### Long-term follow-ups (deferred — out of consolidation scope)

- **PR-14 Telegram visibility re-wire** — `plan-archetype-bridge.ts` needs to call into the new `extensions/telegram/` SDK location once the upstream restructure is mapped
- **Bug B** — stale approval card UI auto-dismiss + `PLAN_APPROVAL_EXPIRED` error code (deferred since iter-2)
- **R1/R2/R3/R4/R5** — robustness fixes (subagent cleanup on crash, cron-nudge suppression, plan title XSS audit, disk-full graceful, multi-channel approval dedup) (deferred since iter-3)
- **D5** — `/plan self-test` slash command (deferred since iter-3)

These do NOT block the umbrella PR landing. They land as follow-on commits on `feat/plan-channel-parity` after #68939 merges.

## Live testing iteration 3 — self-discovery + R6 subagent gate hardening (latest sprint)

Iter-3 closes the meta-gap surfaced by the user: "will plan mode work reliably for ANY install, on ANY agent, including agents that just installed the patch and have never seen plan mode before?" Plus a deeper subagent-gate race (R6) that survived iter-1's tool-side gate.

### Phase 1 — Self-discovery (commit `c262bffcbf`)

**Activation (already in place from iter-2):**

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.planMode.debug true
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Tail BOTH the env-gated structured stream AND the iter-3 always-on
# exit-plan-gate diagnostic in one tail:
tail -F ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log | grep -E '\[plan-mode/|plan-approval-gate|exit-plan-gate'
```

### Deferred to iter-3 commit 3 (next focused commit)

- **D5 — `/plan self-test` slash command** (synthetic plan-mode flow + pass/fail report)
- **R1 — Subagent cleanup on crash/timeout** (drain `openSubagentRunIds` on error paths)
- **R2 — Cron-nudge suppression when approval pending** (heartbeat path already does this via `buildActivePlanNudge:742`; cron-fire path needs same check)
- **R3 — Plan title XSS sanitization audit + test**
- **R4 — Disk-full graceful error in `sessions-patch.ts`**
- **R5 — Multi-channel approval dedup test**
- **Bug B (still deferred from iter-2)** — stale approval card UI auto-dismiss + `PLAN_APPROVAL_EXPIRED` error code

## Live testing iteration 2 — fixes (previous sprint)

Live webchat testing of the iter-1 build (commit `3024c6b215`) on 2026-04-19 surfaced 6 deeper edge cases. All addressed in the next commit on `feat/plan-channel-parity`:

Updated `attempt.ts:549-557` with log-triage hygiene rule + explicit "no chat after exit_plan_mode" reminder                                                                                                                                   |

**Test coverage added:** 8 tests in `fresh-session-entry.test.ts` (deletion-as-normal contract), 5 tests in `plan-mode-debug-log.test.ts` (config-flag gate), 6 tests in `approval.test.ts` (one-line format).

**Activation for live debug session (iter-2 path — RELIABLE on macOS):**

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.planMode.debug true
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Tail with the right filter
tail -F ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log | grep -E '\[plan-mode/|gate decision'
```

The `gate decision` filter catches the always-on Bug C log lines even when the env-gated `[plan-mode/...]` debug stream is off.

### PR-11 escalation cluster — pending maintainer decision

Four threads on PR-11 share the same root cause: post-approval/answer state transitions on `sessions.patch` clear runtime fields needed downstream. See escalation comment #68441 (issuecomment-4273877823). Decision needed:

- **`/plan answer` synthetic-message injection in non-webchat channels** (3 threads: #3105216364, #3105247854, #3105261556) — caller-side per-channel vs gateway-side single source of truth vs won't-fix-this-PR.
- **Post-approval yield retry detection** (1 thread: #3105311664 from re-review) — `resolveYieldDuringApprovedPlanInstruction` predicates unreachable because `planMode → "normal"` clears state. Same root cause cluster.

### "Too many files" structural issue

PR-11's diff vs `upstream/main` is 127 files because the branch was built sequentially on top of every prior PR. Greptile's 100-file review cap and Copilot's 127-of-126-files-reviewed apply to the cumulative diff, not PR-11's true scope (32 net-new files / 2,965 LoC since PR-10's branch tip).

**Resolution path:** land PRs in dependency order so each subsequent PR's diff naturally shrinks. Closing/reopening with main-rebased branches would lose review history without solving the underlying structural cumulative-rollout pattern.

**Recommended landing waves:**

1. **Wave 1** (independent, no plan-mode deps): PR-B, PR-C, PR-F, PR-A
2. **Wave 2** (depend on wave 1): PR-E (after PR-B), PR-D (after PR-C)
3. **Wave 3** (co-merge — each is dead code alone): PR-7 + PR-8
4. **Wave 4**: PR-10 (after PR-8)
5. **Wave 5**: PR-11 (after PR-10)

Co-merge guidance: PR-7, PR-8 land in one merge window. Otherwise main carries dead code.

### Mutation gate (PR-D + PR-8 + PR-10/11 hardening)

When `planMode.mode === "plan"`:

- **Blocked tools** (default-deny + explicit blocklist): `apply_patch`, `bash`, `edit`, `exec` (unless read-only prefix), `gateway`, `message`, `nodes`, `process`, `sessions_send`, `subagents`, `write`
- **Allowed tools**: `read`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `memory_search`, `memory_get`, `update_plan`, `exit_plan_mode`, `enter_plan_mode`, `session_status`, `ask_user_question`, `sessions_spawn`
- **Read-only exec prefixes**: `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `git status|log|diff|show`, `which`, `find`, `grep`, `rg`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `file`, `stat`, `du`, `df`, `echo`, `printenv`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `uname`

**Critical PR-11 review fix**: `agent-runner-execution.ts` now threads `planMode: "plan"` into `runEmbeddedPiAgent`. Pre-fix the gate never activated from the auto-reply path.

### Auto-mode (PR-10)

`SessionEntry.planMode.autoApprove === true` → after every `exit_plan_mode`, `autoApproveIfEnabled` fires `sessions.patch { planApproval: { action: "approve", approvalId }}` immediately. Flag preserved across approve/edit/normal transitions.

### Universal `/plan` slash commands (PR-11)

| Subcommand                | Action                             | Backend route                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/plan accept`            | approve current pending plan       | `sessions.patch { planApproval: { action: "approve" }}` |
| `/plan accept edits`      | approve with allow-edits           | `action: "edit"`                                        |
| `/plan revise <feedback>` | reject + provide feedback          | `action: "reject", feedback`                            |
| `/plan answer <text>`     | answer ask_user_question           | `action: "answer", answer`                              |
| `/plan auto on\|off`      | toggle autoApprove                 | `action: "auto", autoEnabled`                           |
| `/plan on\|off`           | enter/exit plan mode               | `planMode: "plan"\|"normal"`                            |
| `/plan status`            | show current state (read-only)     | (no patch)                                              |
| `/plan view`              | toggle UI sidebar (web only)       | (no patch)                                              |
| `/plan restate`           | re-render plan in chat / send file | (no patch)                                              |

### Telegram visibility (PR-14)

- Every `exit_plan_mode` → render full archetype as markdown → persist to `~/.openclaw/agents/<id>/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (always, audit artifact)
- If session originated from Telegram → also send the .md file as a document attachment with caption containing universal `/plan` resolution commands
- Resolution stays text-based via PR-11's slash commands (sidesteps dual approval-id problem)
- Multi-cycle: collision suffix `-2.md`, `-3.md`, … preserves rejection-revise history

### Plan-nudge crons (PR-9 + PR-12 fixes)

Scheduled at 10/30/60 min after `enter_plan_mode` to prompt the agent if it stalls. Suppressed when:

- `planMode.approval === "pending"` (don't clobber pending approval popup)
- Agent active in last 5 min (`Date.now() - planMode.updatedAt < 5min`)
- Cleaned up on EVERY plan-mode close (approve/reject/edit/off/close-on-complete) to prevent orphan accumulation

## 5. Hardening status (review pass tracking) — historical (per-PR; superseded by umbrella PR review state)

> **STATUS:** The per-PR pass-tracking below is historical. After consolidation (2026-04-19), all bot review work happens on **umbrella PR #68939**. The 10-PR review history is preserved here so reviewers can see what was already addressed before consolidation.

### Escalated comment resolution (this iteration)

**#68440 #3104743333 (Codex P2 — `app-tool-stream.ts:519` — sidebar refresh in update_plan merge mode)**: User chose "best long-term hardened solution" — picked option (c) re-emit merged steps via the existing `agent_plan_event` channel. Lowest perf overhead (no hot-path SessionEntry read), no new event type (channel already exists), and persister already does the same thing for plan-snapshot work. Implementation: in `update-plan-tool.ts` after merge, fire `emitAgentPlanEvent({ phase: "update", steps: mergedPlan, runId })`. UI subscribes to `stream: "plan"` events and refreshes from those.

## 6. Cron upstream conflict (#67807)

Upstream main merged `fix(cron): clean up deleteAfterRun direct deliveries (#67807)` since fork. Touches `src/cron/isolated-agent/delivery-dispatch.ts` ONLY. **No conflict** with PR-12 cron-nudge fix (different surfaces — PR-12 touched `sessions-patch.ts` + `heartbeat-runner.ts`).

---

## 7. Process going forward (clean baseline)

### Naming convention

- **Sprint #**: `PR-A` ... `PR-11` (chronological internal order)
- **Upstream #**: `#NNNNN` (GitHub PR number on upstream openclaw/openclaw)
- 1:1 mapping except PR-9/12/13/14 which are internal sprints riding on `feat/plan-channel-parity`

### Branch policy

- Local branches on `100yenadmin/openclaw-1` (fork) ONLY — never push to upstream
- Each PR's local branch is the head of the upstream cross-repo PR
- `feat/plan-channel-parity` is the LIVE branch (cumulative; what runs locally)
- Other 9 branches are individual PR scopes

### Push & install loop

1. Make changes
2. `pnpm format:fix && pnpm lint && pnpm tsgo` (only flag NEW errors; pre-existing baseline OK)
3. `pnpm test <touched-files>` (must pass)
4. `pnpm build && pnpm ui:build` (order matters — build wipes dist/)
5. `FAST_COMMIT=1 scripts/committer "msg" file...` (scope to changed files only)
6. `git push` to `origin/<branch>`
7. `npm install -g .` to update global CLI
8. `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway`
9. `openclaw status --probe` to confirm live

### Review-loop policy

- Use `pr-review-loop` skill on each PR
- 95% confidence threshold (stricter than skill default 70%)
- Don't change agent prompts — flag for user
- Multiple sprints (2-3) per PR for hardening
- Mark stale comments "no longer relevant" when fix already shipped on cumulative branch

### Verification gates (release-bar)

- All scoped tests pass
- Lint 0 errors
- Tsgo no new errors (baseline pre-existing OK)
- Build + UI build clean
- Live install smoke-tests cleanly via webchat + Telegram
