## Nuclear-fix-stack integration — 2026-04-19 (post-wave-7)

After review-loop wave 7 converged at 100% thread resolution, another agent ([@eva@100yen.org](mailto:eva@100yen.org)) surfaced a **9-commit "nuclear-fix stack"** on `feat/plan-mode-nuclear-fix-stack` addressing 5 correctness gaps in PR #68939 that the review waves only partially covered. Stack landed via cherry-pick (Option A from the integration ask comment).

### The 5 bugs fixed

```

### Resolution decisions during integration

- **Schema additions truly orthogonal**: both stacks coexist in `SessionEntry`. Field order: `pendingAgentInjection` (legacy/deprecated, auto-migrated) → `pendingAgentInjections` (queue) → `pendingQuestionApprovalId` → `pendingQuestionOptions` → `pendingQuestionAllowFreetext` → `postApprovalPermissions`.
- **`sessions-patch.ts` answer branch layered**: wave-3/4 answer-guard validation chain (approvalId match + option-membership for non-freetext) fires BEFORE `appendToInjectionQueue`. Both validations preserved.
- **`pending-injection.ts` full rewrite** taken from the side branch as a queue-shim; once-and-only-once docstring backported as a comment block.
- **WIP contamination strip on commit 4 (`b6b2783ba3`)**: ~150 lines of unrelated bootstrap refactor + ollama-runtime imports + dead-export removals dropped from `attempt.ts`. Only the ~3-line `getLatestAcceptEdits` threading kept. Same pattern applied in `pi-tools.ts` and `params.ts` where the cherry-pick removed our HEAD's existing `memberRoleIds` / `isCanonicalWorkspace` fields (restored).
- **`resolveSessionTotalTokens` rename**: the side branch's commit 1 renamed this export to `resolveFreshSessionTotalTokens` but didn't update the 2 consumers (`src/commands/sessions.ts`, `src/commands/status.summary.ts`). Updated both consumers — the rename is semantically meaningful (communicates the fresh-read pattern).
- **Pre-existing test repair**: `run.overflow-compaction.test.ts` asserted `mockedRunEmbeddedAttempt` was called 32 times (pre-PR-9-Tier-1 floor). Bumped to 500 to match `MIN_RUN_RETRY_ITERATIONS`. Same root cause flagged in the side branch's wave-5 disclosure.

### New surface (post-integration)

- **Files added**: `src/agents/plan-mode/injections.ts` (+ `.test.ts`), `src/agents/plan-mode/accept-edits-gate.ts` (+ `.test.ts`)
- **Types added**: `PendingAgentInjectionKind`, `PendingAgentInjectionEntry`, `PostApprovalPermissions`
- **Fields added on `AgentRunContext`**: `lastSubagentSettledAt: number`, `getLatestAcceptEdits: () => boolean`
- **Public exports from `src/agents/plan-mode/index.ts`**: `buildAcceptEditsPlanInjection`, `appendToInjectionQueue`, `enqueuePendingAgentInjection`, `consumePendingAgentInjections`, `composePromptWithPendingInjections`, `SUBAGENT_SETTLE_GRACE_MS` (= 10_000), `MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS_IN_PLAN_MODE` (= 1)
- **New error code**: `ErrorCodes.PLAN_APPROVAL_WAITING_FOR_SUBAGENT_SETTLE` — returned from `sessions.patch { planApproval: approve | edit }` with `details.retryAfterMs` when the user clicks approve within 10s of a subagent completion
- **New constants**: `POST_APPROVAL_ACK_ONLY_GRACE_MS` (= 5 \* 60_000), `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` (= 10, oldest eviction with warn log), `DEFAULT_INJECTION_PRIORITY`

### Test coverage delta

| Suite                                  | Pre-integration | Post-integration |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `injections.test.ts`                   | (didn't exist)  | 27 tests         |
| `accept-edits-gate.test.ts`            | (didn't exist)  | 44 tests         |

| `approval.test.ts`                     | 32              | 39               |
| **Total touched-surface**              | **~92**         | **~187 (+95)**   |

Plus existing `sessions-patch.test.ts` (43 tests, including the queue-migration test update where `entry.pendingAgentInjection === "[QUESTION_ANSWER]: ..."` is now `entry.pendingAgentInjections[0].text === "..."`).

### Deferred items (carried over from side branch's adversarial review)

All disclosed in the agent's [architectural walkthrough](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/68939#issuecomment-4276170359); kept deferred here as follow-ups:

1. **Retry re-hydration on empty-response failure** (>100 LoC) — pending-injection consumer drains before the first attempt; empty-response retry has no context. Workaround today: post-approval ack-only grace covers the common failure mode. **Status: still deferred** — C4.2 scope requires a new `SessionEntry.lastConsumedInjections` field + retry-logic changes; targeted for a focused follow-up commit.
2. **Shell-escape destructive bypass** (pattern-limited) — env-var indirection / concat / alias redefinition can slip past the acceptEdits destructive denylist; prompt layer remains primary defense. **Status: shipped in 1.0 follow-up C4** (`dcb9f0ec7d`) — layered-defense detection at `accept-edits-gate.ts` with 26 adversarial fixtures covering env-var indirection, backtick + `$(...)` subshells, quote concatenation, hex/octal byte escapes.
3. **Double-approve on legacy-scalar upgrade** (<50% probability) — narrow scenario with bounded impact (duplicate "I'll execute..." ack, not broken state). **Status: verified closed** during the C4 audit; the existing atomic migration in `plan-mode/injections.ts` prevents the race.
4. **approvalRunId persister silent-bypass** (<0.1% probability). **Status: shipped in 1.0 follow-up C4** — defensive throw in `plan-snapshot-persister.ts:persistApprovalMetadata` on empty/missing `approvalRunId`, with diagnostic message calling out the subagent-gate implication.
5. **Debug log multi-tag recording** (observability only). **Status: partially shipped in 1.0 follow-up C7** (`c0aaabb1f1`) — added optional `approvalRunId` + `approvalId` correlation fields to 7 of 8 debug event kinds; wired through the two `approval_event` emitters in `sessions-patch.ts`. Remaining emitters (nudge crons, subagent lifecycle, gate decisions) pick up the fields as those surfaces are next touched.
6. **Bootstrap context truncation** (AGENTS.md/SOUL.md diet) — separate PR.

### Still deferred out of 1.0 follow-up

| Item                                          | Why deferred                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **C3b** `approvalTimeoutSeconds` runtime      | Needs either a new `timeout` action on the sessions.patch protocol or a gateway-internal bypass RPC + cron scheduling + cleanup. Substantial cross-surface change best handled as its own focused commit. |
| **C4.2** retry re-hydration                   | Needs new `SessionEntry.lastConsumedInjections` field + modifications to `consumePendingAgentInjections` + retry-logic re-inject. Not trivial.                                                            |

### Rollback escalation path

Per side-branch disclosure (still applies):

- Commit 70a6e4b23a (queue) regression → revert nuclear-fix stack; `pendingAgentInjection` legacy scalar path still works via the queue-shim's auto-migrate-on-first-read.
- Commit 7110953c0c (acceptEdits gate) false-positive → revert that commit only; `action: "edit"` falls back to approve-path semantics.
- Commit 436d308506 (subagent grace window) too strict → set `SUBAGENT_SETTLE_GRACE_MS = 0`; no revert needed.
- Full feature regression → `agents.defaults.planMode.enabled: false` short-circuits everything.
- Catastrophic failure → `git push --force-with-lease origin feat/plan-channel-parity-backup:feat/plan-channel-parity` restores pre-rebase HEAD `bee5e8c364`.

## Consolidation pass — 2026-04-19

After 3+ weeks of iter-1/iter-2/iter-3 hardening on `feat/plan-channel-parity`, the 10 individual PRs reviewed against stale base branches were **consolidated into a single umbrella PR rebased onto current upstream/main**.

### Why consolidate

- Branch was **734 commits behind** `upstream/main` and **135 commits ahead**
- Latest upstream tag `v2026.4.19-beta.2` had landed ~24h before the rebase
- Review bots (Greptile, Copilot, Codex) were comparing PRs against 3-week-old main snapshots: re-firing on resolved threads, suggesting "fixes" for patterns that already landed elsewhere, drowning real signal in noise
- 10 dependent PRs forced maintainers to load the dependency graph just to start review

### What was preserved

- **Full 135-commit history** (no squash — `git blame` and the iter-1/2/3 narrative both stay readable)
- **240+ resolved review threads** from the original 10 PRs (rationale lives in this doc + commit messages)
- **All test coverage** (200+ tests across the touched surface — 81 scoped tests verified passing post-rebase)
- **All architecture decisions** documented in this file (sections below stay authoritative)

### What was closed

### Rebase mechanics — only 5 actual conflicts in 134 commits

Audit before rebase confirmed upstream had **zero plan-mode commits in the gap**. All conflicts were incidental file overlaps:

### Post-rebase residual fixes (`01ed63633e`)

Two type errors surfaced after the rebase landed and were fixed in a follow-on commit on the rebased branch:

- **`src/agents/plan-mode/plan-archetype-bridge.ts`** — replaced the `sendDocumentTelegram` call with a deferred no-op + `void` discards on the unused `caption`/`absPath`/`parseTelegramThreadId`. Plan markdown still persists to `~/.openclaw/agents/<id>/plans/`; Telegram attachment delivery awaits the PR-14 re-wire follow-up.
- **`src/gateway/server-runtime-subscriptions.ts`** — removed the `params.minimalTestGateway` conditional (the param was renamed/dropped in upstream's restructure). Persister always starts; tests pass `emitSessionsChanged: () => {}` to suppress.

The `parseTelegramThreadId` helper is preserved as commented-out code in `plan-archetype-bridge.ts` so the PR-14 re-wire follow-up can resurrect the parsing logic without rewriting it.

### Umbrella PR #68939 status

- **Branch:** `feat/plan-channel-parity` @ `01ed63633e`
- **Diff vs upstream/main:** 135 commits, 145 files changed
- **Greptile review:** SKIPPED (hit 100-file ceiling — known limitation; not actionable)
- **Copilot review:** triggered via `@copilot please review` comment
- **CI:** parity gate IN_PROGRESS at write-time
- **Mergeable:** ✅ MERGEABLE per `gh pr view`

### Long-term follow-ups (deferred — out of consolidation scope)

- **PR-14 Telegram visibility re-wire** — `plan-archetype-bridge.ts` needs to call into the new `extensions/telegram/` SDK location once the upstream restructure is mapped
- **Bug B** — stale approval card UI auto-dismiss + `PLAN_APPROVAL_EXPIRED` error code (deferred since iter-2)
- **R1/R2/R3/R4/R5** — robustness fixes (subagent cleanup on crash, cron-nudge suppression, plan title XSS audit, disk-full graceful, multi-channel approval dedup) (deferred since iter-3)
- **D5** — replaced by `plan_mode_status` + targeted lifecycle tests in the stacked follow-up to #68939

These do NOT block the umbrella PR landing. They land as follow-on commits on `feat/plan-channel-parity` after #68939 merges.

**Test coverage added:** 7 tests in `sessions-patch.subagent-gate.test.ts`, 12 tests in `plan-mode-debug-log.test.ts`. Pre-existing test suites (`incomplete-turn`, `mutation-gate`, `exit-plan-mode-tool`, `fresh-session-entry`) all still pass after the prefix changes (constants are imported by reference, not literal-asserted).

## Live testing iteration 3 — self-discovery + R6 subagent gate hardening (latest sprint)

Iter-3 closes the meta-gap surfaced by the user: "will plan mode work reliably for ANY install, on ANY agent, including agents that just installed the patch and have never seen plan mode before?" Plus a deeper subagent-gate race (R6) that survived iter-1's tool-side gate.

### Phase 1 — Self-discovery (commit `c262bffcbf`)

| D7  | `plan-mode-101` skill              | New `skills/plan-mode-101/SKILL.md` — same content as the in-mode reference card, available on-demand in normal mode via trigger phrases ("explain plan mode", "what does [PLAN_DECISION] mean", etc.)                                                                                                                                          |

Bypass cases (no runId, ctx not registered, openSubagentRunIds undefined) now emit explicit reason strings so operators can tell why the gate didn't fire. Operator can grep `agents/exit-plan-gate` in `gateway.err.log` to see every submission attempt                                   |
| R6b | Subagent announce-turn injection said "narrate the result" — agent treated the turn as TERMINAL and stopped, breaking the plan-mode flow | The announce reply instruction at `subagent-announce.ts:buildAnnounceReplyInstruction` told the agent "send that user-facing update now." Agent narrated the subagent result and stopped instead of calling `exit_plan_mode` after incorporating the result.

**Activation (already in place from iter-2):**

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.planMode.debug true
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Tail BOTH the env-gated structured stream AND the iter-3 always-on
# exit-plan-gate diagnostic in one tail:
tail -F ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log | grep -E '\[plan-mode/|plan-approval-gate|exit-plan-gate'
```

### Deferred to iter-3 commit 3 (next focused commit)

- **D5 — dropped.** The runtime now uses `plan_mode_status`, focused regression suites, and session-state rehydration coverage instead of a synthetic self-test command.
- **R1 — Subagent cleanup on crash/timeout** (drain `openSubagentRunIds` on error paths)
- **R2 — Cron-nudge suppression when approval pending** (heartbeat path already does this via `buildActivePlanNudge:742`; cron-fire path needs same check)
- **R3 — Plan title XSS sanitization audit + test**
- **R4 — Disk-full graceful error in `sessions-patch.ts`**
- **R5 — Multi-channel approval dedup test**
- **Bug B (still deferred from iter-2)** — stale approval card UI auto-dismiss + `PLAN_APPROVAL_EXPIRED` error code

## Live testing iteration 2 — fixes (previous sprint)

Live webchat testing of the iter-1 build (commit `3024c6b215`) on 2026-04-19 surfaced 6 deeper edge cases. All addressed in the next commit on `feat/plan-channel-parity`:

Updated both `getLatestPlanMode` callbacks in `agent-runner-execution.ts` to use it. Hardened consumers in `pi-tools.before-tool-call.ts:230` and `run.ts:1834` to prefer the helper's value (only fall back to cached snapshot when helper returns `undefined` from a true disk failure) |

Adversarial-feedback sanitization preserved (closing-marker neutralization still active for defense-in-depth)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| F   | Agent demonstrably misused tools: posted chat after `exit_plan_mode` (Bug A trigger), confused `update_plan` vs `exit_plan_mode`, read multi-MB logs from line 1                                      | Tool descriptions said WHAT but not WHEN/HOW; system prompt had no log-triage rule and no "stop after exit_plan_mode" rule                                                                                                          | Updated `describeExitPlanModeTool` (STOP-AFTER-TOOL-CALL as first line), `describeUpdatePlanTool` (TRACKING-ONLY clarification), `describeEnterPlanModeTool` (lifecycle 1-2-3-after pattern). Updated `attempt.ts:549-557` with log-triage hygiene rule + explicit "no chat after exit_plan_mode" reminder                                                                                                                                   |

**Test coverage added:** 8 tests in `fresh-session-entry.test.ts` (deletion-as-normal contract), 5 tests in `plan-mode-debug-log.test.ts` (config-flag gate), 6 tests in `approval.test.ts` (one-line format).

**Activation for live debug session (iter-2 path — RELIABLE on macOS):**

```bash
openclaw config set agents.defaults.planMode.debug true
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway

# Tail with the right filter
tail -F ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log | grep -E '\[plan-mode/|gate decision'
```

The `gate decision` filter catches the always-on Bug C log lines even when the env-gated `[plan-mode/...]` debug stream is off.

### PR-11 escalation cluster — pending maintainer decision

Four threads on PR-11 share the same root cause: post-approval/answer state transitions on `sessions.patch` clear runtime fields needed downstream. See escalation comment #68441 (issuecomment-4273877823). Decision needed:

- **`/plan answer` synthetic-message injection in non-webchat channels** (3 threads: #3105216364, #3105247854, #3105261556) — caller-side per-channel vs gateway-side single source of truth vs won't-fix-this-PR.
- **Post-approval yield retry detection** (1 thread: #3105311664 from re-review) — `resolveYieldDuringApprovedPlanInstruction` predicates unreachable because `planMode → "normal"` clears state. Same root cause cluster.

### "Too many files" structural issue

PR-11's diff vs `upstream/main` is 127 files because the branch was built sequentially on top of every prior PR. Greptile's 100-file review cap and Copilot's 127-of-126-files-reviewed apply to the cumulative diff, not PR-11's true scope (32 net-new files / 2,965 LoC since PR-10's branch tip).

**Resolution path:** land PRs in dependency order so each subsequent PR's diff naturally shrinks. Closing/reopening with main-rebased branches would lose review history without solving the underlying structural cumulative-rollout pattern.

**Recommended landing waves:**

1. **Wave 1** (independent, no plan-mode deps): PR-B, PR-C, PR-F, PR-A
2. **Wave 2** (depend on wave 1): PR-E (after PR-B), PR-D (after PR-C)
3. **Wave 3** (co-merge — each is dead code alone): PR-7 + PR-8
4. **Wave 4**: PR-10 (after PR-8)
5. **Wave 5**: PR-11 (after PR-10)

Co-merge guidance: PR-7, PR-8 land in one merge window. Otherwise main carries dead code.

### Mutation gate (PR-D + PR-8 + PR-10/11 hardening)

When `planMode.mode === "plan"`:

- **Blocked tools** (default-deny + explicit blocklist): `apply_patch`, `bash`, `edit`, `exec` (unless read-only prefix), `gateway`, `message`, `nodes`, `process`, `sessions_send`, `subagents`, `write`
- **Allowed tools**: `read`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `memory_search`, `memory_get`, `update_plan`, `exit_plan_mode`, `enter_plan_mode`, `session_status`, `ask_user_question`, `sessions_spawn`
- **Read-only exec prefixes**: `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `git status|log|diff|show`, `which`, `find`, `grep`, `rg`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `file`, `stat`, `du`, `df`, `echo`, `printenv`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `uname`

**Critical PR-11 review fix**: `agent-runner-execution.ts` now threads `planMode: "plan"` into `runEmbeddedPiAgent`. Pre-fix the gate never activated from the auto-reply path.

### Auto-mode (PR-10)

`SessionEntry.planMode.autoApprove === true` → after every `exit_plan_mode`, `autoApproveIfEnabled` fires `sessions.patch { planApproval: { action: "approve", approvalId }}` immediately. Flag preserved across approve/edit/normal transitions.

### Universal `/plan` slash commands (PR-11)

| Subcommand                | Action                             | Backend route                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/plan accept`            | approve current pending plan       | `sessions.patch { planApproval: { action: "approve" }}` |
| `/plan accept edits`      | approve with allow-edits           | `action: "edit"`                                        |
| `/plan revise <feedback>` | reject + provide feedback          | `action: "reject", feedback`                            |
| `/plan answer <text>`     | answer ask_user_question           | `action: "answer", answer`                              |
| `/plan auto on\|off`      | toggle autoApprove                 | `action: "auto", autoEnabled`                           |
| `/plan on\|off`           | enter/exit plan mode               | `planMode: "plan"\|"normal"`                            |
| `/plan status`            | show current state (read-only)     | (no patch)                                              |
| `/plan view`              | toggle UI sidebar (web only)       | (no patch)                                              |
| `/plan restate`           | re-render plan in chat / send file | (no patch)                                              |

### Telegram visibility (PR-14)

- Every `exit_plan_mode` → render full archetype as markdown → persist to `~/.openclaw/agents/<id>/plans/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (always, audit artifact)
- If session originated from Telegram → also send the .md file as a document attachment with caption containing universal `/plan` resolution commands
- Resolution stays text-based via PR-11's slash commands (sidesteps dual approval-id problem)
- Multi-cycle: collision suffix `-2.md`, `-3.md`, … preserves rejection-revise history

### Plan-nudge crons (PR-9 + PR-12 fixes)

Scheduled at 10/30/60 min after `enter_plan_mode` to prompt the agent if it stalls. Suppressed when:

- `planMode.approval === "pending"` (don't clobber pending approval popup)
- Agent active in last 5 min (`Date.now() - planMode.updatedAt < 5min`)
- Cleaned up on EVERY plan-mode close (approve/reject/edit/off/close-on-complete) to prevent orphan accumulation

### Escalated comment resolution (this iteration)

**#68440 #3104743333 (Codex P2 — `app-tool-stream.ts:519` — sidebar refresh in update_plan merge mode)**: User chose "best long-term hardened solution" — picked option (c) re-emit merged steps via the existing `agent_plan_event` channel. Lowest perf overhead (no hot-path SessionEntry read), no new event type (channel already exists), and persister already does the same thing for plan-snapshot work. Implementation: in `update-plan-tool.ts` after merge, fire `emitAgentPlanEvent({ phase: "update", steps: mergedPlan, runId })`. UI subscribes to `stream: "plan"` events and refreshes from those.

## 6. Cron upstream conflict (#67807)

Upstream main merged `fix(cron): clean up deleteAfterRun direct deliveries (#67807)` since fork. Touches `src/cron/isolated-agent/delivery-dispatch.ts` ONLY. **No conflict** with PR-12 cron-nudge fix (different surfaces — PR-12 touched `sessions-patch.ts` + `heartbeat-runner.ts`).

---

## 7. Process going forward (clean baseline)

### Naming convention

- **Sprint #**: `PR-A` ... `PR-11` (chronological internal order)
- **Upstream #**: `#NNNNN` (GitHub PR number on upstream openclaw/openclaw)
- 1:1 mapping except PR-9/12/13/14 which are internal sprints riding on `feat/plan-channel-parity`

### Branch policy

- Local branches on `100yenadmin/openclaw-1` (fork) ONLY — never push to upstream
- Each PR's local branch is the head of the upstream cross-repo PR
- `feat/plan-channel-parity` is the LIVE branch (cumulative; what runs locally)
- Other 9 branches are individual PR scopes

### Push & install loop

1. Make changes
2. `pnpm format:fix && pnpm lint && pnpm tsgo` (only flag NEW errors; pre-existing baseline OK)
3. `pnpm test <touched-files>` (must pass)
4. `pnpm build && pnpm ui:build` (order matters — build wipes dist/)
5. `FAST_COMMIT=1 scripts/committer "msg" file...` (scope to changed files only)
6. `git push` to `origin/<branch>`
7. `npm install -g .` to update global CLI
8. `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.gateway`
9. `openclaw status --probe` to confirm live

### Review-loop policy

- Use `pr-review-loop` skill on each PR
- 95% confidence threshold (stricter than skill default 70%)
- Don't change agent prompts — flag for user
- Multiple sprints (2-3) per PR for hardening
- Mark stale comments "no longer relevant" when fix already shipped on cumulative branch

### Verification gates (release-bar)

- All scoped tests pass
- Lint 0 errors
- Tsgo no new errors (baseline pre-existing OK)
- Build + UI build clean
- Live install smoke-tests cleanly via webchat + Telegram
