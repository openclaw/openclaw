# `openclaw status`

Diagnostics for channels + sessions.

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw status --all
openclaw status --deep
openclaw status --usage
```

Notes:

- `--deep` runs live probes (WhatsApp Web + Telegram + Discord + Google Chat + Slack + Signal).
- Output includes per-agent session stores when multiple agents are configured.
- Overview includes Gateway + node host service install/runtime status when available.
- Overview includes update channel + git SHA (for source checkouts).
- Update info surfaces in the Overview; if an update is available, status prints a hint to run `openclaw update` (see [Updating](/install/updating)).
- Read-only status surfaces (`status`, `status --json`, `status --all`) resolve supported SecretRefs for their targeted config paths when possible.
- If a supported channel SecretRef is configured but unavailable in the current command path, status stays read-only and reports degraded output instead of crashing. Human output shows warnings such as “configured token unavailable in this command path”, and JSON output includes `secretDiagnostics`.
