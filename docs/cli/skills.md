## Commands

```bash
evox skills search "calendar"
evox skills install <slug>
evox skills install <slug> --version <version>
evox skills update <slug>
evox skills update --all
evox skills list
evox skills list --eligible
evox skills info <name>
evox skills check
```

`search`/`install`/`update` use ClawHub directly and install into the active
workspace `skills/` directory. `list`/`info`/`check` still inspect the local
skills visible to the current workspace and config.
