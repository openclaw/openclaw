## Commands

```bash
openclaw skills search "calendar"
openclaw skills install <slug>
openclaw skills install <slug> --version <version>
openclaw skills update <slug>
openclaw skills update --all
openclaw skills list
openclaw skills list --eligible
openclaw skills info <name>
openclaw skills check
```

`search`/`install`/`update` use ClawHub directly and install into the active
workspace `skills/` directory. `list`/`info`/`check` still inspect the local
skills visible to the current workspace and config.
