# `openclaw backup`

Create a local backup archive for OpenClaw state, config, credentials, sessions, and optionally workspaces.

```bash
openclaw backup create
openclaw backup create --output ~/Backups
openclaw backup create --dry-run --json
openclaw backup create --verify
openclaw backup create --no-include-workspace
openclaw backup verify ./openclaw-backup-2026-03-09T00-00-00.000Z.tar.gz
```

## Notes

- The archive includes a `manifest.json` file with the resolved source paths and archive layout.
- Default output is a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive in the current working directory.
- If the current working directory is inside a backed-up source tree, OpenClaw falls back to your home directory for the default archive location.
- Existing archive files are never overwritten.
- Output paths inside the source state/workspace trees are rejected to avoid self-inclusion.
- `openclaw backup verify <archive>` validates that the archive contains exactly one manifest and that every manifest-declared payload exists in the tarball.
- `openclaw backup create --verify` runs that validation immediately after writing the archive.
