# `openclaw agents`

Manage isolated agents (workspaces + auth + routing).

## Examples

```bash
openclaw agents list
openclaw agents list --bindings
openclaw agents add work --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-work
openclaw agents add ops --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace-ops --bind telegram:ops --non-interactive
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --avatar avatars/openclaw.png
openclaw agents delete work
```

## Agent role evals

OpenClaw includes a reusable agent role eval harness for local operator checks:

```bash
pnpm agents:eval
pnpm agents:eval:contracts
pnpm agents:eval:live -- --agent judge --timeout 180
pnpm agents:eval:live -- --model ollama/glm-4.7-flash
pnpm agents:eval:live:self-contained -- --agent judge --model ollama/qwen3.5:4b
```

`pnpm agents:eval` is deterministic and checks configured agents against role contracts, model references, workspace identity docs, runtime directories, and tool-policy sanity. `pnpm agents:eval:contracts` validates only the checked-in role contract catalog, so it can run in shared local and CI gates without private operator state. `pnpm agents:eval:live` is opt-in and runs real local agent turns against the same contracts. `pnpm agents:eval:live:self-contained` creates temporary workspaces, agent runtime directories, and config for the selected contracts before running the live turn, which makes scheduled CI/Testbox proof independent of private operator state. The self-contained live fixture pins low-variance stream params (`temperature: 0`, `maxTokens: 64`) so small local models stay focused on the strict five-line role contract. Set `OPENCLAW_AGENT_ROLE_EVAL_REPORT_DIR` when running the workflow helper to write summary JSON, summary Markdown, per-agent JSON results, and raw stdout/stderr logs for durable evidence; run `node scripts/agent-role-eval-workflow.mjs verify-report <dir>` with the same live-agent/model/timeout environment to fail closed on missing, malformed, incomplete, mismatched, or failed reports.

## Routing bindings

Use routing bindings to pin inbound channel traffic to a specific agent.

If you also want different visible skills per agent, configure `agents.defaults.skills` and `agents.list[].skills` in `openclaw.json`. See [Skills config](/tools/skills-config) and [Configuration reference](/gateway/config-agents#agents-defaults-skills).

List bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents bindings
openclaw agents bindings --agent work
openclaw agents bindings --json
```

Add bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops --bind discord:guild-a
```

The `openclaw agent --agent` run selector accepts either the configured agent id
or an unambiguous slug of the configured display name. For example, an agent
with `id: "main"` and `name: "Control Director"` can be targeted as either
`--agent main` or `--agent control-director`.

If you omit `accountId` (`--bind <channel>`), OpenClaw resolves it from channel defaults and plugin setup hooks when available.

If you omit `--agent` for `bind` or `unbind`, OpenClaw targets the current default agent.

### Binding scope behavior

- A binding without `accountId` matches the channel default account only.
- `accountId: "*"` is the channel-wide fallback (all accounts) and is less specific than an explicit account binding.
- If the same agent already has a matching channel binding without `accountId`, and you later bind with an explicit or resolved `accountId`, OpenClaw upgrades that existing binding in place instead of adding a duplicate.

Example:

```bash
# initial channel-only binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram

# later upgrade to account-scoped binding
openclaw agents bind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
```

After the upgrade, routing for that binding is scoped to `telegram:ops`. If you also want default-account routing, add it explicitly (for example `--bind telegram:default`).

Remove bindings:

```bash
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --bind telegram:ops
openclaw agents unbind --agent work --all
```

`unbind` accepts either `--all` or one or more `--bind` values, not both.

## Command surface

### `agents`

Running `openclaw agents` with no subcommand is equivalent to `openclaw agents list`.

### `agents list`

Options:

- `--json`
- `--bindings`: include full routing rules, not only per-agent counts/summaries

### `agents add [name]`

Options:

- `--workspace <dir>`
- `--model <id>`
- `--agent-dir <dir>`
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--non-interactive`
- `--json`

Notes:

- Passing any explicit add flags switches the command into the non-interactive path.
- Non-interactive mode requires both an agent name and `--workspace`.
- `main` is reserved and cannot be used as the new agent id.
- In interactive mode, auth seeding copies only portable static profiles
  (`api_key` and static `token` by default). OAuth refresh-token profiles remain
  available only by read-through inheritance from the real `main` agent store.
  If the configured default agent is not `main`, sign in separately for OAuth
  profiles on the new agent.

### `agents bindings`

Options:

- `--agent <id>`
- `--json`

### `agents bind`

Options:

- `--agent <id>` (defaults to the current default agent)
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--json`

### `agents unbind`

Options:

- `--agent <id>` (defaults to the current default agent)
- `--bind <channel[:accountId]>` (repeatable)
- `--all`
- `--json`

### `agents delete <id>`

Options:

- `--force`
- `--json`

Notes:

- `main` cannot be deleted.
- Without `--force`, interactive confirmation is required.
- Workspace, agent state, and session transcript directories are moved to Trash, not hard-deleted.
- When the Gateway is reachable, deletion is sent through the Gateway so config and session-store cleanup share the same writer as runtime traffic. If the Gateway cannot be reached, the CLI falls back to the offline local path.
- If another agent's workspace is the same path, inside this workspace, or contains this workspace,
  the workspace is retained and `--json` reports `workspaceRetained`,
  `workspaceRetainedReason`, and `workspaceSharedWith`.

## Identity files

Each agent workspace can include an `IDENTITY.md` at the workspace root:

- Example path: `~/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md`
- `set-identity --from-identity` reads from the workspace root (or an explicit `--identity-file`)

Avatar paths resolve relative to the workspace root.

## Set identity

`set-identity` writes fields into `agents.list[].identity`:

- `name`
- `theme`
- `emoji`
- `avatar` (workspace-relative path, http(s) URL, or data URI)

Options:

- `--agent <id>`
- `--workspace <dir>`
- `--identity-file <path>`
- `--from-identity`
- `--name <name>`
- `--theme <theme>`
- `--emoji <emoji>`
- `--avatar <value>`
- `--json`

Notes:

- `--agent` or `--workspace` can be used to select the target agent.
- If you rely on `--workspace` and multiple agents share that workspace, the command fails and asks you to pass `--agent`.
- When no explicit identity fields are provided, the command reads identity data from `IDENTITY.md`.

Load from `IDENTITY.md`:

```bash
openclaw agents set-identity --workspace ~/.openclaw/workspace --from-identity
```

Override fields explicitly:

```bash
openclaw agents set-identity --agent main --name "OpenClaw" --emoji "🦞" --avatar avatars/openclaw.png
```

Config sample:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "main",
        identity: {
          name: "OpenClaw",
          theme: "space lobster",
          emoji: "🦞",
          avatar: "avatars/openclaw.png",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```
