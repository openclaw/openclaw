# `openclaw commands`

`openclaw commands` provides a read-only inventory of command information OpenClaw already owns.
It does not execute commands, grant permission, or enforce policy.

## List commands

```bash
openclaw commands list
openclaw commands list --json
openclaw commands list --markdown
openclaw commands list --json --plugin-descriptors
```

The inventory joins these command-owned sources:

- static core and sub-CLI descriptors
- routed command paths and their operation metadata
- commands registered in the current CLI invocation
- plugin CLI descriptors when `--plugin-descriptors` is supplied

Human output is Markdown by default. Use `--json` for the versioned machine-readable shape.
`--json` and `--markdown` cannot be combined.

Plugin descriptor discovery is opt-in because it activates plugin registration. When requested,
loader failures and error-level plugin diagnostics fail the command instead of returning an
apparently complete partial inventory. Plugin warnings remain visible on stderr.

## Inspect one path

```bash
openclaw commands inspect gateway
openclaw commands inspect nodes run --json
openclaw commands inspect memory --json --plugin-descriptors
```

`inspect` hydrates the requested lazy core or sub-CLI group, resolves runtime aliases, and returns
the records that match that exact command path. The result includes `found`, the requested and
resolved paths, and matching descriptors, routes, routed operations, runtime registrations, plugin
registrations, and caller-supplied node records.

An unknown path returns `found: false` in JSON or `No matching command was found` in Markdown.

## Inventory semantics

The JSON result includes `schemaVersion: 1`, source identity, discovery mode, visibility, and effect
metadata where the owning registry provides it. Missing effect metadata is not a safety claim.
Callers should not infer that an unannotated command is read-only or low risk.

The current runtime command scope is the command tree registered for this invocation. Plugin
commands appear only with `--plugin-descriptors`. Node command records are supported by the catalog
model but this CLI does not fetch live paired-node commands.

The existing Gateway `commands.list` RPC remains the agent-facing chat, native, skill, and plugin
inventory. This CLI is an operator and developer view and does not replace that RPC.

| `--markdown`           | Emit Markdown explicitly; this is the default human format.     |
| `--plugin-descriptors` | Load plugin CLI descriptors and include their command metadata. |
