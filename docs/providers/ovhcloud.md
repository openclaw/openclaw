## Model overview

OVHcloud AI Endpoints offers access to multiple open-weight models through a
serverless inference API. The recommended model is **gpt-oss-120b**, a powerful 120 billion parameter model made by OpenAI.

You can also explore our [catalog](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/ai-endpoints/catalog) to browse all our available models.

## Setup

### Quick start

Configure via CLI:

```bash
clawdbot onboard --auth-choice ovhcloud-api-key
```

Or set the API key manually:

```bash
export OVHCLOUD_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Config snippet

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "ovhcloud/gpt-oss-120b" },
    },
  },
}
```

## Notes

- Model refs use `ovhcloud/<model>` format.
- Your data is not reused or kept by OVHcloud; data privacy is guaranteed.
- Update pricing values in `models.json` if you need exact cost tracking.
- See [Model providers](/concepts/model-providers) for provider rules.
- Use `clawdbot models list` and `clawdbot models set ovhcloud/gpt-oss-120b` to switch models.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unknown model: ovhcloud/model-name"

This usually means the **OVHcloud provider isn't configured** (no provider entry and no OVHcloud auth profile/env key found). Fix by:

- Running `clawdbot configure` and selecting **OVHcloud**, or
- Adding the `models.providers.ovhcloud` block manually, or
- Setting `OVHCLOUD_API_KEY` (or an OVHcloud auth profile) so the provider can be injected.

Make sure the model id is **case-sensitive**: `ovhcloud/gpt-oss-120b`.

Then recheck with:

```bash
clawdbot models list
```
