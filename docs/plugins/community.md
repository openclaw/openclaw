## Required for listing

- Source code is hosted on GitHub (public repository).
- Repository includes setup/use docs and an issue tracker.
- Plugin has a clear maintenance signal (active maintainer, recent updates, or responsive issue handling).

## How to submit

Open a PR that adds your plugin to this page with:

- Plugin name
- npm package name
- GitHub repository URL

## Review bar

We prefer plugins that are useful, documented, and safe to operate.
Low-effort wrappers, unclear ownership, or unmaintained packages may be declined.
