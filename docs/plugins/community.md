# Community Plugins

Community plugins are third-party packages that extend OpenClaw with new
channels, tools, providers, or other capabilities. They are built and maintained
by the community, published on [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) or npm, and
installable with a single command.

```bash
openclaw plugins install <package-name>
```

OpenClaw checks ClawHub first and falls back to npm automatically.
