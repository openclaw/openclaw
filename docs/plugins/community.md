# Community plugins

This page tracks high-quality **community-maintained plugins** for OpenClaw.

We accept PRs that add community plugins here when they meet the quality bar.

## Required for listing

- Plugin package is published on npmjs (installable via `openclaw plugins install <npm-spec>`).
- Source code is hosted on GitHub (public repository).
- Repository includes setup/use docs and an issue tracker.
- Plugin has a clear maintenance signal (active maintainer, recent updates, or responsive issue handling).

## How to submit

Open a PR that adds your plugin to this page with:

- Plugin name
- npm package name
- GitHub repository URL
- One-line description
- Install command

## Review bar

We prefer plugins that are useful, documented, and safe to operate.
Low-effort wrappers, unclear ownership, or unmaintained packages may be declined.

## Candidate format

Use this format when adding entries:

- **Plugin Name** — short description
  npm: `@scope/package`
  repo: `https://github.com/org/repo`
  install: `openclaw plugins install @scope/package`

## Listed plugins

- **Civic Google** — Eliminate all Google OAuth setup for your OpenClaw deployment. Without this plugin, integrators must run `gog auth add`, manage OAuth credentials, and handle token refresh manually. With it, Civic AuthZ owns the full credential lifecycle: tokens are fetched fresh on every call, refreshed automatically, and scoped to exactly what the agent needs (e.g. `gmail.readonly` for search, `gmail.compose` for drafts — never over-permissioned). Supports Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Sheets, and Docs via the built-in `gog` CLI.
  npm: `@civic/openclaw-google`
  repo: `https://github.com/civicteam/openclaw-google`
  install: `openclaw plugins install @civic/openclaw-google`

- **WeChat** — Connect OpenClaw to WeChat personal accounts via WeChatPadPro (iPad protocol). Supports text, image, and file exchange with keyword-triggered conversations.
  npm: `@icesword760/openclaw-wechat`
  repo: `https://github.com/icesword0760/openclaw-wechat`
  install: `openclaw plugins install @icesword760/openclaw-wechat`
