## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a **self-hosted AI assistant** and **MCP-compatible gateway** that connects your favorite chat apps, tools, and browser workflows to one always-available runtime. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine or server, and it becomes the bridge between Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, iMessage, browser automation, and multi-agent execution.

**Who is it for?** Developers, operators, and power users who want a personal or team AI assistant they can message from anywhere without giving up control of their data, routing, or runtime.

**What makes it different?**

- **Self-hosted**: runs on your hardware, your rules
- **Multi-channel**: one Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously
- **MCP-compatible**: connect Model Context Protocol tools and assistant workflows through one runtime
- **Agent-native**: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, browser automation, and multi-agent routing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

**What do you need?** Node 24 (recommended), or Node 22 LTS (`22.16+`) for compatibility, an API key from your chosen provider, and 5 minutes. For best quality and security, use the strongest latest-generation model available.

## Popular ways teams use OpenClaw

- Run a self-hosted AI assistant on a Mac mini, Linux box, homelab machine, or VPS.
- Turn Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or iMessage into a persistent AI bot inbox.
- Connect browser automation, Canvas, nodes, and MCP tools to one long-running gateway.
- Route different channels, groups, users, and tasks to different agents or workspaces.
- Add VeriClaw for evidence-first correction, runtime truth, and delivery integrity.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

- If you **do nothing**, OpenClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` and (for groups) mention rules.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
  messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw"] } },
}
```
