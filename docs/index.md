## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a **self-hosted gateway** that connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.

**Who is it for?** Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.

**What makes it different?**

- **Self-hosted**: runs on your hardware, your rules
- **Multi-channel**: one Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously
- **Agent-native**: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

**What do you need?** Node 22+, an API key (Anthropic recommended), and 5 minutes.

## How it works

The Gateway is the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections.

## Dashboard

Open the browser Control UI after the Gateway starts.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

- If you **do nothing**, OpenClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` and (for groups) mention rules.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
  messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw"] } },
}
```
