# exe.dev

Goal: SmartAgentNeo Gateway running on an exe.dev VM, reachable from your laptop via: `https://<vm-name>.exe.xyz`

This page assumes exe.dev's default **exeuntu** image. If you picked a different distro, map packages accordingly.

## Beginner quick path

1. [https://exe.new/smart-agent-neo](https://exe.new/smart-agent-neo)
2. Fill in your auth key/token as needed
3. Click on "Agent" next to your VM, and wait...
4. ???
5. Profit

## What you need

- exe.dev account
- `ssh exe.dev` access to [exe.dev](https://exe.dev) virtual machines (optional)

## Automated Install with Shelley

Shelley, [exe.dev](https://exe.dev)'s agent, can install SmartAgentNeo instantly with our
prompt. The prompt used is as below:

```
Set up SmartAgentNeo (https://docs.smart-agent-neo.ai/install) on this VM. Use the non-interactive and accept-risk flags for smart-agent-neo onboarding. Add the supplied auth or token as needed. Configure nginx to forward from the default port 18789 to the root location on the default enabled site config, making sure to enable Websocket support. Pairing is done by "smart-agent-neo devices list" and "smart-agent-neo device approve <request id>". Make sure the dashboard shows that SmartAgentNeo's health is OK. exe.dev handles forwarding from port 8000 to port 80/443 and HTTPS for us, so the final "reachable" should be <vm-name>.exe.xyz, without port specification.
```

## Manual installation

## 1) Create the VM

From your device:

```bash
ssh exe.dev new
```

Then connect:

```bash
ssh <vm-name>.exe.xyz
```

Tip: keep this VM **stateful**. SmartAgentNeo stores state under `~/.smart-agent-neo/` and `~/.smart-agent-neo/workspace/`.

## 2) Install prerequisites (on the VM)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git curl jq ca-certificates openssl
```

## 3) Install SmartAgentNeo

Run the SmartAgentNeo install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://smart-agent-neo.ai/install.sh | bash
```

## 4) Setup nginx to proxy SmartAgentNeo to port 8000

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` with

```
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    listen 8000;
    listen [::]:8000;

    server_name _;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Standard proxy headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Timeout settings for long-lived connections
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

## 5) Access SmartAgentNeo and grant privileges

Access `https://<vm-name>.exe.xyz/` (see the Control UI output from onboarding). If it prompts for auth, paste the
token from `gateway.auth.token` on the VM (retrieve with `smart-agent-neo config get gateway.auth.token`, or generate one
with `smart-agent-neo doctor --generate-gateway-token`). Approve devices with `smart-agent-neo devices list` and
`smart-agent-neo devices approve <requestId>`. When in doubt, use Shelley from your browser!

## Remote Access

Remote access is handled by [exe.dev](https://exe.dev)'s authentication. By
default, HTTP traffic from port 8000 is forwarded to `https://<vm-name>.exe.xyz`
with email auth.

## Updating

```bash
npm i -g smart-agent-neo@latest
smart-agent-neo doctor
smart-agent-neo gateway restart
smart-agent-neo health
```
