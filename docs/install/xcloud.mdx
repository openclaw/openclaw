title: Deploy on xCloud
---

Deploy OpenClaw on [xCloud](https://xcloud.host/openclaw-hosting/) using a fully managed server with a preconfigured stack. This setup removes manual configuration and runs OpenClaw as a root user inside your VPS.

xCloud provisions and secures the entire VPS with a locked-down firewall, automated updates, backups, and SSL. You can manage OpenClaw directly from the dashboard and easily disable the web dashboard to restrict access when needed.

## What you need

Before deploying OpenClaw on xCloud, make sure you have the following ready:

- An active [xCloud account](https://xcloud.host/docs/how-to-deploy-openclaw-with-xcloud/)
- An xCloud managed server with at least 4GB RAM
- API keys from your preferred AI provider (Anthropic, Claude Code, OpenAI, or Google Gemini)
- Optional messaging credentials, such as Telegram Bot Token and Telegram User ID, if you plan to control OpenClaw through chat

OpenClaw runs only on xCloud-managed servers. You cannot deploy it on existing, external, or shared servers.

## Beginner quick path

If you want the fastest way to get started, follow this path:

1. Create a new xCloud managed server
2. Select OpenClaw as the app type
3. Choose server size, region, and Ubuntu version
4. Enter your AI provider API key
5. Optionally connect a messaging platform for chat-based access (optional)
6. Complete provisioning from the dashboard
7. Copy the Control UI URL and login credentials
8. Start chatting with OpenClaw

This path avoids manual configuration and lets you manage everything from the xCloud dashboard.

## What we're actually setting up

- Create a managed VPS on xCloud
- Provision OpenClaw automatically during server setup
- Run OpenClaw as root inside the isolated VPS environment
- Secure the VPS with a locked-down firewall, SSL, and automated updates
- Store OpenClaw data on the server

Follow this guide when you are deploying through the xCloud dashboard. You do not need Docker, manual CLI setup, or SSH tunneling for standard deployment.

## Step 1: Create an xCloud managed server

Start by creating a new xCloud managed server from the dashboard.

1. Click **Start Now** from the xCloud dashboard
2. Enter a server name and an optional tag
3. Select **App Type: OpenClaw**. xCloud automatically provisions OpenClaw during server creation

### Choose server type and size

xCloud offers two types of managed servers: General and Premium. Choose your preferred one. Select a server size with at least 4GB RAM, which is required to run OpenClaw.

### Choose region and OS

- Select your preferred continent and server location from 30+ locations
- Choose an Ubuntu version

### Backups

xCloud allows you to automate backups during server creation. If backups are enabled, your OpenClaw server data is stored according to your selected backup schedule.

The OpenClaw stack is selected automatically.

### Confirm security notice

Read the security warning carefully and confirm that you understand the risks and limitations before continuing.

### Enter your AI provider credentials

Select your preferred AI provider, such as Anthropic, Claude Code, OpenAI, and Google Gemini, and enter the required credentials.

### Set up messaging platform (optional)

From the xCloud dashboard, you can set up your messaging platform. Select your messaging platform and enter the required credentials.

#### Telegram

1. Enter your Telegram Bot Token
2. Enter your Telegram User ID
3. Continue to the next step

When you provide your Telegram User ID during setup, your account is allowlisted. No manual pairing commands are required.

### Control UI access (optional)

You can restrict access to the OpenClaw Control UI.

1. Enable or disable OpenClaw Control UI Dashboard
2. Disable it if you want to prevent public UI access

### Complete deployment

Click **Create** to start server provisioning and OpenClaw deployment.

Once deployment finishes:

1. Open **Status** from the dashboard
2. Collect the Control UI URL
3. Collect the Basic Auth password

Use these credentials to log in and start chatting with OpenClaw.

## Step 2: Manage OpenClaw from the xCloud dashboard

After deployment, all management happens inside the xCloud dashboard.

### Access credentials and UI controls

From **Status**:

- View UI URL and authentication credentials
- Toggle Control UI access on or off

Disabling the UI blocks all OpenClaw dashboard access. You will be able to manage with the messaging platform.
