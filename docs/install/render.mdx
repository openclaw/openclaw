# Deploy OpenClaw on Render

Run your personal agentic assistant on Render.

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is a personal agentic assistant that integrates with a variety of messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Slack.

Note that some capabilities of OpenClaw expect a macOS environment, such as integrations with the macOS Notes and Reminders apps. These capabilities are not supported on Render.

## What you'll deploy

Your OpenClaw deployment consists of a single Render [web service](https://render.com/docs/web-services) that includes:

- **OpenClaw gateway** — The core AI assistant runtime
- **Proxy server** — A lightweight Go wrapper that provides token authentication and health checks
- **Persistent disk** — Retains your configuration, sessions, and workspace files across deploys

This deployment uses the **Standard** instance type, which is the smallest instance type that supports OpenClaw. For details on instance pricing, see the [pricing page](https://render.com/pricing#services).

## 1. Sign up for Render

Signing up is fast and free:

## 2. Copy the example template

Render provides a template that simplifies deploying OpenClaw using a [Render Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code):

1. Open the [render-examples/openclaw-render template](https://github.com/render-examples/openclaw-render) on GitHub.
2. Click **Use this template > Create a new repository** in the top right.
3. In the form that appears, set configuration options for your new repo, then click **Create repository**.

## 3. Create a Render Blueprint

Your newly created repo contains a `render.yaml` file that defines your OpenClaw web service:

```yaml
# An excerpt from render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: openclaw
    runtime: docker
    plan: standard
    healthCheckPath: /health
    # ...
```

The full file in your repo includes all required environment variables and configuration.

To deploy using [Blueprints](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code):

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), click **New > Blueprint**.
2. If you haven't yet, connect your GitHub account to Render. This enables Render to fetch the `render.yaml` file from your repo.
3. Under **Connect a repository**, click the **Connect** button for the repo you created earlier. This opens a Blueprint creation form.
4. Provide a **Blueprint Name** and confirm that you're pulling the **Branch** you expect from your repo.
5. You'll be prompted to enter values for environment variables for various AI providers. Provide API keys for each provider you intend to use.
6. Review the costs associated with your Blueprint, then click **Deploy Blueprint**. Render kicks off the initial sync, which creates your web service.

## 4. Access the Control UI

1. After your web service's deploy completes, navigate to your web service's page in the Render Dashboard. Its `onrender.com` URL appears at the top.
2. When you first visit this URL, a dialog appears.
3. Obtain your service's `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` from its **Environment** page in the Render Dashboard. This value was generated automatically as part of your Blueprint's first sync.

   **Your gateway token is a secret credential!** Do not share this token with anyone. If you believe it's been compromised, replace its value from your service's **Environment** page.

4. Paste your token in the **Gateway Token** field and click **Continue**.

You're all set! Your browser redirects to the OpenClaw Control UI.

You're up and running with OpenClaw on Render! To start connecting messaging channels, customizing your assistant's behavior, and exploring available skills, see the [official OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai).
