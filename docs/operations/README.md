# Operations Playbooks

Use these templates to keep runtime health, blockers, and session outcomes consistent.

## Files

- `STATUS_TEMPLATE.md`: Current runtime truth with timestamps and health checks.
- `OPERATIONS_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md`: Actionable blocker tracking with owners and deadlines.
- `SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`: Standardized session closure format.

## Workflow

1. Start each day by creating `STATUS.md` from `STATUS_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Add or update blockers in `OPERATIONS_BACKLOG.md` from the backlog template.
3. End each work session with a report from `SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`.
4. Only mark work complete when status checks and acceptance checks are green.
